            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is manifeſt, that the end, for which Almighty God created Man, was, that beeing indowed not onely with that inferiour part, which is common to him with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures; but alſo with the peculiar priuiledge and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of a Coeleſtiall minde;

               </gap>e Beaſtes accuſe them of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which by a certain inſtinct of Nature ſeeme to retaine a memory of the benefite they haue
<pb facs="tcp:177899:4"/> receiued. Whom leaſt you ſhould ſeeme (deare brethren) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, you are accuſtomed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the frequent partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the holy Sacraments, to giue your ſelues daily to the pious meditation of Heauenly thinges: That although in your bodyes you bee heere on Earth, yet your minde is tranſported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heauen, where you conuerſe with the bleſſed Saints, and with Chriſt himſelfe, labouring to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite your minde to him, from whome at firſt it did proceed. This Godly endeauour both of you, and all pious perſons, that I might in ſome ſort promote and further, I haue gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuors Meditations of the Paſſion of our bleſſed Sauiour, which may miniſter vnto you
<pb facs="tcp:177899:5"/> occaſion and matter of many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute and profitable contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which Meditations I haue thought good to commend vnto you for diuers reaſons: Firſt, becauſe nothing is of ſuch force to mooue mens mindes, and to inflame them with the fire of the loue of God, as the ſerious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of benefites, eſpecially ſuch as are ſo great, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſo great a Lord and God. Some indeede, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are oppreſſed with the burthen of ſinne, are oftentimes re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laimed from their wickednes with the horror of Death, Iudgement, and the paines of Hell: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the vertuous ſort, and ſuch as ſerue Almighty God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for loue than feare, are wholy ſet on fire with the loue of their
<pb facs="tcp:177899:5"/> Redeemer through the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and meditation of his Death and Paſſion. Secondly, becauſe nothing doth ſo eaſily preſent it ſelfe vnto our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as the meditation of the paines, torments, ſorrowes, and tribulations, wherewith in our whole life we are enuironed, and beſet on euery ſide. As for Heauen, Hell, and the laſt Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe they are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to our ſight, and ſeeme to be a farre off, we doe not ſufficiently conceiue or apprehend the ſame: but for the afflictions of the body and the anguiſhes of the minde, we vnderſtand oftentimes by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience more then wee would. Thirdly, becauſe I know no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation to be more acceptable to our bleſſed Sauiour, then that
<pb facs="tcp:177899:6"/> which wee conceiue of the bitter paſſion, that hee ſuffered for vs. For as a Conqueror doth reioyce at the remembrance of his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, ſo we may well thinke, that Chriſt our Lord is delighted, when wee doe often remember his Paſſion; both becauſe by ſo blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a combat hee hath obtained a perpetuall and renowned victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both for himſelfe and vs; and alſo becauſe herein hee ſeeth our thankefulnes which wee render vnto him for ſo great a benefite. Fourthly, becauſe I perceiued that the meditation of no other thing could bee ſo neceſſary for Man-kinde, as of that, from which alone is deriued vnto vs the remiſſion of our ſinnes, our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, our workes of merite, and our whole ſaluation. Which
<pb facs="tcp:177899:6"/> certainly is the principall cauſe, why the Catholike Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtitution of the Apoſtles, hath ordained that the memory of this Paſſion ſhould by ſundry wayes be ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iterated; as, by making the ſigne of the Croſſe with our handes: by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Images of the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Laye people are accuſtomed to vſe in ſtead of Bookes; by faſting on Fridayes and Saterdayes; by the yearely celebritry of the Paſſion in the end of Lent; by Sermons, by Leſſons, by ſounding of Bells and ſuch like, yea Chriſt himſelfe hath inſtituted a moſt ſacred and daily remembrance of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit the holy Sacrifice of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſe, wherein his dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, and ſhedding of his bloud is moſt
<pb facs="tcp:177899:7"/> clearly repreſented vnto vs. Fiftly, becauſe greater vtility redoundeth vnto vs by theſe Meditations, then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of any other thing whatſoeuer. For as all good thinges are purchaſed for vs by the merites of our Sauiours Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo in the ſame as in a wel fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſhop all precious wares of vertues and good examples are to bee found.</p>
            <p>But that you may more eaſily reape theſe fruites, I thinke it requiſite to propoſe vnto you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aduertiſements touching the beſt manner of Meditation. For many are deceiued, which thinke it is ſufficient to repeat in their mindes the hiſtory of the Paſſion, or by conſideration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to feele an inward delight;
<pb facs="tcp:177899:7"/> whereas notwithſtanding, that auaileth little to their ſaluation, if withall, the affection and wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bee not thereby mooued. For meate neuer ſatisfieth a man, if hee onely looke vpon it, and doe not put it into his mouth, chewe it with his teeth, and let it downe into his ſtomacke. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge indeed of the Hiſtory is the ground of Meditation, and the diſcourſes of the vnderſtanding doe affoord the matter, but all the profite conſiſteth in this, that the will, which beareth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſway in man, bee moued with many affections: for ſhe onely meriteth, ſhe onely loueth, ſhe onely directeth all our thoughtes, and actions towards God.</p>
            <p>Therefore to comprehend all in fewe wordes, thoſe which haue
<pb facs="tcp:177899:8"/> treated beſt of this matter of Meditation, haue deſigned and ſet downe vnto vs ſeauen affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of the minde, which may bee moued with this conſideration of the Paſſion: To wit; Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Compunction, Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, Thankeſgiving, Admiration, Hope, and the Loue of God. Which I will explicate vnto you briefly and in fewe wordes, to the end you may vnderſtand, after what manner you may bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with profite in theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meditations. For by theſe ſeauen wayes, as by ſeauen teeth, the matter miniſtred by theſe Meditations may bee chewed, and with the affection taſted, and d <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>geſted.</p>
            <p>The firſt therefore is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> that is, an affection of
<pb facs="tcp:177899:8"/> the minde, by which we partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of other mens griefes, and afflictions, feeling the ſame though not in body yet in minde: by which affection, the griefe of the Patient ſeemeth to bee diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and communicated with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and is thereby greatly mittigated and aſſwaged; as on the contrary ſide it is much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and increaſed, if either we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eride him, or bee not moued with his afflictions. Chr ſt our Sauiour, to diminiſh our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, would ſuffer for vs, and condole alſo wish vs, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith: <hi>Wee haue not a High Prieſt, that cannot haue compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on our infirmities, but tempted in all thinges by ſimilitude, except ſinne.</hi> And truly although we cannot leſſen
<pb facs="tcp:177899:9"/> by this our ſorrowe the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and exeſſiue ſorrowes that our Sauiour ſuffered for vs; yet this our compaſſion is moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him, whereby we make his dolours ours, and apply his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings vnto our ſelues. Wherefore the Apoſtle hath ſaid very right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>We are coheires of Chriſt, yet if we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified with him.</hi> For hee that will not bee a partaker with Chriſt in his ſufferings, cannot be a partaker with him in his kingdome. There are two thinges which are moſt availeable to prouoke this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration. Firſt the condition of the perſon, that is to ſay, his nobility, his goodneſſe, his piety towards men, and ſuch other things, which doe aggrauate the
<pb facs="tcp:177899:9"/> indignity of his inflicted miſerie. Secondly, the cruelty and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his torments. If therefore we deſire to fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in our hearts this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſeration, we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in euery article, Firſt, who it is that ſuffereth: As firſt, that it is God, who with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty filleth Heauen and Earth; ſecondly, a moſt honorable man, deſcended of the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and conceiued by the holy Ghoſt in the wombe of the Virgine; thirdly, one moſt learned in his vnderſtanding, and moſt holy in his will, who by no error or ſinne, did euer offend either God or man; fourthly, moſt graue and ſober in his conuerſation, being neuer ſeene to laugh, but often to weepe, and that for our ſinnes; fiftly, more beautifull in his body
<pb facs="tcp:177899:10"/> then all the ſonnes of men, and of a more tender and delicate complexion. Secondly wee muſt ſet before our eyes the greatnes of his torments, and with what particular payne euery member was afflicted. Conſidering firſt, that all the ſences of his body, and all the powres of his ſoule ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their proper and peculiar tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Secondly, that his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s were moſt grieuous, both by reaſon of the moſt tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of his body, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanted all interior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to indure the ſame. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is the vndoubted opinion of all Diuines, that neuer any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature indured ſuch paynes and torments as our bleſſed Sauiour did. If we ſee a wicked man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch puniſhment, as he hath
<pb facs="tcp:177899:10"/> moſt iuſtly deſerued, we cannot but be moued to compaſſion and griefe: and if we ſee but a Dogge or an Aſſe cruelly whipped or beaten, we are preſently touched with commiſeration. Ought we not then to condole with the Son of God, ſuffering ſo vnſpeakable tortures, and that for our ſakes?</p>
            <p>The ſecond affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> or ſorrowe for our ſinnes, when we are induced to an horror and deteſtation of our ſinnes by the remembrance of our Sauiours paſſion: which may eaſily be done, if we ponder what the malice of ſinne is, and what torments it hath drawne vpon Chriſt our Sauiour. As God is infinite, ſo the malice of ſinne, which is committed againſt God, is alſo infinite: and this malice
<pb facs="tcp:177899:11"/> in the iuſtice of God (which ought not to be violated) could not by any ſatisfaction be taken away, but by that, which was infinite. Wherfore either an infinite paine was to be endured, which no finite creature could endure; or for an infinite time, which the damned in hell endure; or by an infinite perſon, which is God himſelfe. Hence let vs proceede, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what it was that drewe God from Heauen to earth, and induced him to vndergoe his paſſion; which was nothing elſe but our ſinnes. For if man had neuer ſinned, God had neuer been incarnated, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uer ſuffered, neuer dyed. Wherefore, like as for the ſinner, his ſinnes prepare a place in hell; &amp; for the thiefe, his theft prepareth his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb facs="tcp:177899:11"/> ſo for our bleſſed Sauiour our grieuous ſins haue procured a neceſſity of ſuffering death. The malice therefore of ſinne is aboue all things to bee deteſted, which cauſed euen our Lord God himſelfe to bee crucified. But leaſt thou ſhouldeſt imagine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs, that the grieuouſneſſe of ſinne is heereby extenuated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt did not ſuffer for thy ſinnes alone, but for the ſinnes of all the world; be thou aſſured of this, that the malice of ſinne is not thereby diminiſhed or impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but the ſingular vertue of our Sauiours paſſion is declared, which hath waſhed away the ſins not of this or that man, but of all the men in the world. For the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of his paſſion is infinite, and no malice whatſoeuer is able to
<pb facs="tcp:177899:12"/> counteruaile it: which thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth ſufficiently diſcouer the grieuouſnes of ſinne, becauſe without the infinite merite of Chriſt it could not be forgiuen. As therefore if one only man ſee the Sunne, it will ſhine no more to him alone, then it would doe to him, and all other men together; and as a man doth no leſſe kill another when alone he ſtabbeth him to the heart, then if he ſhould take ten or twelue others to aſſiſt him in the ſame: ſo euen one mortall ſinne (for redeeming whereof the death and paſſion of the Sonne of God was neceſſary) is no leſſe the cauſe of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours death, then all the ſinnes of the world ioyned together. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the paſſion of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bring vs leſſe profite, being
<pb facs="tcp:177899:12"/> vndertaken for the vniuerſall ſaluation of the world, then if it had beene vndertaken for mee alone.</p>
            <p>The third affection is <hi>Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Imitation.</note> whereby wee deſire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and imitate thoſe rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, which we diſcouer in Chriſt, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs: <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you an example, that you may followe his ſteppes.</hi> And againe: <hi>Chriſt hauing ſuffered for vs in the fleſh, be you alſo armed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4</note> There are two thinges princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to bee imitated in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Paſſion. The one is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſuffer for vs. The other is, a great heap of vertues, which appeared ſo plainly in this his Paſſion, that though our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb facs="tcp:177899:13"/> ſpake nothing, yet by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from the Pulpit as it were of the Croſſe he taught all kinde of vertues; yea and taught them moſt perfectly, both for that hee was deſtitute of all interior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which doth ordinarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our vertuous acts; and alſo becauſe there wanted not meanes, whereby hee might haue reſiſted his Paſſion. Wherefore in euery Meditation wee muſt ſearch out, Firſt, what vertue is chiefly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; Secondly, how our Sauiour exerciſed the ſame; And laſtly wee muſt ſtirre vp a deſire, and firme purpoſe to obtaine that vertue, deuiſing the meanes wherehy it may bee acquired, &amp; imploring the aſſiſtance of our Sauiour to accompliſh our inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
<pb facs="tcp:177899:13"/> Chriſt in his Paſſion gaue vs a patterne of all vertues, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of thoſe which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe ſo often commend vnto vs. Of which the firſt is <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> whereby being moſt bitterly ſcoffed at, cloathed in a white and purple garment, crowned with a crowne of thornes, leſſe eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eemed then the murtherer <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas,</hi> crucified betwixt two Theeues, and ſuffering many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mockings and contempts, he alwaies humbly behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The ſecond is <hi>Meekenes,</hi> whereby he euer ſhewed himſelfe milde and gentle to all men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured torments moſt patiently, was ſilent in all reproches and iniuries; neuer vſed any excuſes, neuer offended any body with his language or froward actions.
<pb facs="tcp:177899:14"/> The third is <hi>Obedience,</hi> which then deſerueth greateſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, when hard thinges are commanded, &amp; by wicked men. Chriſt was not onely obedient to his Father euen vnto death,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> yea the death of the Croſſe; but alſo to wicked Iudges and torturers, whome he obeyed ſimply, cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and conſtantly, when hee put off his garments, put on the purple, receiued the Crowne of Thornes, caryed his owne Croſſe, ſtretched out his hands and feete to be nayled, and did many other things that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him. The fourth is <hi>Charity,</hi> which then onely ſeemeth to be perfect, when as for Gods ſake wee loue, not onely our friends, but alſo our enemies, eſteeming them not our enemies, but our friendes.
<pb facs="tcp:177899:14"/> Which our Lord ſeemeth to haue performed moſt aboundantly, when ſpeaking of his moſt perfect loue towards vs, hee ſaid, <hi>No man hath greater charity then this, that a man giue his life for his friends.</hi> For albeit, it may ſeeme greater charity to yeild our life for our enemies; yet that charity is indeed moſt perfect which acknowledgeth no enemies, but reputeth thoſe for our friends, which are our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and doth good no leſſe to them then to our friends. Now Chriſt was ſo tenderly affected towards his enemies, that the more iniuries and wrongs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at their hands, the more his loue encreaſed towards them, and the greater benefites he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them; like vnto fire,
<pb facs="tcp:177899:15"/> which the more it is blowed, the hotter it burneth. Therefore in the whole time of his paſſion he prayed vnto God his Father for his enemies: <hi>For this that they ſhould loue me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 108</note> 
               <hi>they detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from me, and I prayed in minde but not in voyce,</hi> But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was faſtned to the Croſſe, and the bloud ranne out of the foure fountaines of his hands &amp; feete, then with a loud voyce he prayed for them that crucified him: &amp; at the laſt when he yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp his ſpirite, he moued with exceeding charity the heartes of the ſtanders by to faith and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. The firſt is <hi>Mercy,</hi> which is the daughter of charity. By this our Lord gaue vnto vs his garments, honour, fame, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, flouriſhing age, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth,
<pb facs="tcp:177899:15"/> health, &amp; life. The ſixt is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world,</hi> by which he refuſed all thinges which the world admireth, and accounteth good; and tooke vpon him thoſe things which the world abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; for riches chooſing pouerty, for honours contempt, for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures paines, for comme dations mockings. The ſeauenth is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance,</hi> through which being neither ouercome by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſorrowes, nor moued by the heauines of his friends, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the deriſion of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor wearied with the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his body, he would not come down from the Croſſe, which he had aſcended for thy ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>The fourth is <hi>Thankſgiuing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</note> by which, pondering the benefites beſtowed vpon vs, wee breake
<pb facs="tcp:177899:16"/> foorth into praiſes, not in wordes onely, which is the leaſt praiſe, and action of thankes, but rather in heart and workes; that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our mindes the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite beſtowed vpon vs, we ſhould eſteeme much thereof, and take heede of all offending our Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and omitt no occaſion in all things to requite it. There are fiue thinges, which doe mooue much vnto this thankefulneſſe. Firſt, the euill, which we haue eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped. Secondly, the good, which we haue receiued by the benefite. Thirdly, the worthineſſe of our Benefactor. Fourthly, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the benefite beſtowed. And fiftly, the condition of the perſon vpon whome the benefite is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Therefore that we may be moued to thankefulneſſe, wee
<pb facs="tcp:177899:16"/> muſt conſider: firſt, the euills, which we haue eſcaped through this paſſion of Chriſt; as ſinne the greateſt of all euills; blindnes of minde; hardnes of heart; bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the deuill; fowlenes of the ſoule; the preſent perill of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fire, ſo grieuous, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceiued; ſo long, as it hath no end; ſo certaine, as without Chriſt it cannot bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded. Secondly, the goods, which we haue gayned; as grace, iuſtice, the adoption to bee the ſonnes of God, Sacraments, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, vertues, the promiſe of euerlaſting life, and to be briefe, all the goods both of body and minde. For there is no good thing in mans life, which the paſſion of Chriſt hath not either giuen or preſerued. Thirdly, the dignity
<pb facs="tcp:177899:17"/> of the perſon: for euen as we vſe to allowe a greater ſtipend to a Nobleman, or Doctor, for a ſmell office, then to a plaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try man, for a great labour: ſo we ought to be more thankefull to the more worthy perſon. How thankefull then ſhall we bee to Chriſt, who is of infinite dignity? Fourthly, the manner of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite beſtowed, to wit, gratis, and not without great labour. God made Heauen and Earth without any trouble by his onely word: but thee he redeemed with paynes, bloud, and his owne life: and for all theſe benefites he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nothing of thee, but praiſe and thankefulnes. Fiftly, the condition of the perſon, vpon whome the benefite is beſtowed; if baſe, if an enemy, if ingrateful.
<pb facs="tcp:177899:17"/> What are we then? If (as the wiſe man ſayeth) <hi>The whole world before God is as a drop of the morning deawe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle. 11.</note> 
               <hi>which falleth vpon the earth:</hi> What in compariſon of God ſhall one ſilly man be, who being compared with the whole world, &amp; with all the multitude of men is nothing. Holy <hi>Iob</hi> hath expreſſed our baſeneſſe: <hi>I ſaid to rottennes, thou art my Father;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and to the wormes, my Mother &amp; my Siſter.</hi> Now, we are not only baſe, but we were alſo enemies, eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, &amp; averted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, neither ſeeking, nor deſiring his grace, but rather reiecting it, when it was offered. When therefore thou ſhalt conſider, firſt, that thou art deliuered from the greateſt, moſt certain, &amp; euerlaſting miſeries;
<pb facs="tcp:177899:18"/> ſecondly, that thou art indued with moſt high and infinite goods: thirdly, by the moſt mighty God, of infinite maieſtie; fourthly, with ſo great labours and paines, as neuer any mortall creature ſuſtayned: thou canſt not chooſe but thinke, whether it is fit that ſo abiect a creature ſhould bee diſſolued into praiſe &amp; thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</p>
            <p>The fift is conceiuing <hi>Hope.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hope.</note> By the conſideration of three things our hope is much ſhaken and weakened. Firſt of the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is required for eternall life,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.</note> into which nothing defiled or vncleane ſhall enter. Secondly, of the ſtrict examination of the Iudge, who will demaund an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of euery idle worde, and will reach euen vnto the diuiſion
<pb facs="tcp:177899:18"/> of the ſoule and the ſpirit, and will ſearch out the cogitations &amp; intentions of the heart. Thirdly, of our baſenes, who both offend the iuſtice of God with our dayly ſinnes &amp; liue full of concupiſence &amp; imperfections, &amp; do not enter into the inward cogitations of our hearts.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> 
               <hi>And if I be ſimple</hi> (ſaith Iob) <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uen this my ſoule ſhall not knowe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 6.</note> To this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Paſſion of Chriſt giueth help and remedy, and lifteth vp the hart of a ſinner to confidence and hope. For firſt, as the glory of eternall life requireth great cleannes: ſo the Paſſion &amp; blood of Chriſt waſheth away all our i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities; it cauſeth our ſoules to be more bright then the Sunne; it maketh vs the ſonnes of God, it giueth vs right vnto euerlaſting
<pb facs="tcp:177899:19"/> life, that now we goe not into a ſtrange, but into our owne inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. Secondly, the iudgement of Chriſt is very ſtrict; but the merits of the Paſſion of Chriſt can wel beare the ſeuerity therof; becauſe the ſatiſfaction is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the debt; and our ſinnes being in number infinite, his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are in value infinite; and to be briefe, he ſhall be our Iudge, which was our Aduocat, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and Redeemer, who, that he might giue vs heauen, payd the price thereof for vs, that is to ſay, his bloud, which he ſhed for our ſinnes, being not ignorant of the value and dignity of that which he ſhed with ſo great paine and labour. Thirdly our baſenes is very great, being able to doe nothing of our ſelues; but
<pb facs="tcp:177899:19"/> his grace being communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs through the merite of his Paſſion, addeth an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſplendor and brightnes to our ſoules, remitteth all our ſinnes, giueth vs ſtrength nnd power to worke, and addeth ſuch dignity to our workes, as to bee able to merit euerlaſting life. Therefore our hope will be much confirmed, if we conſider, that all the wealth of Chriſt, all his merits, all his faſtings, labours, paines, and, to be briefe, all that euer he did, or ſuffered, is ours, no leſſe then the goods of the huſband belong vnto the wife, which ſhe may vſe for the payment of her debtes, and her other neceſſities.</p>
            <p>The ſixt is, the <hi>Loue of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Loue of God.</note> And firſt the nobility &amp; beauty of the thing beloued ſtirreth vp
<pb facs="tcp:177899:20"/> the affection of Loue; euen as we are enflamed with the deſire of vertues and ſciences through their beauty and excellency. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Loue,</hi> when we ſee our ſelues firſt beloued. And to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe this Loue, it auayleth much: Firſt if wee ſee the loue of our Louer prooued, not onely by word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, but alſo by great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites. Secondly, if hee procured theſe benefites for vs by his owne great labour and diſcommodity. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irdly, if we often repelled him, and did him iniuries, and yet his loue was not diminiſhed thereby. Fourthly, if by all his labours &amp; troubles he deſireth nothing but to bee beloued againe. All theſe hath Chriſt done for vs in his Paſſion. Firſt hee loued vs in deede and truth, and gaue vs all
<pb facs="tcp:177899:20"/> good thinges. Secondly, hee to his great diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity became poore, that hee might inrich vs; and tooke vpon him ſelfe all euills, that hee might repleniſh vs with all goodnes. Thirdly, being ſo often repelled by vs, hee abated nothing of his Loue. Fourthly, hee requireth nothing of vs, but our Loue. Loue (ſaith hee) and it is enough. Moreouer, that thou mayeſt loue, thou muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the Lawes and conditions of a Louer, which Chriſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this his Paſſion. The firſt is, that we alwayes thinke of that which we Loue; and this by the example of Chriſt himſelfe, who, becauſe hee would neuer forget vs, ingraued vs in his owne handes. Secondly, that we ſpeake often of it: for <hi>Out of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
<pb facs="tcp:177899:21"/> of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> and this alſo by the example of Chriſt, who on the very Croſſe ſpake to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vs, and prayed vnto him for vs. Thirdly, that we feare nothing more, then to offend him whome wee loue, as Chriſt hath taught vs, who referred his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and all that hee had to this end, that hee might induce vs to loue him. Fourthly, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all our labours and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to helpe our freind: for Chriſt laboured not for himſelfe, but for vs. Fiftly, that we ſhould deſire to bee alwayes with our friend: for <hi>The delight of Chriſt is, to bee with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonnes of men,</hi> who hath ſought vs, in Sea and Land, in the Ayer, &amp; in Hell; that hauing found vs hee
<pb facs="tcp:177899:21"/> might ioyne vs with him in euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bliſſe, and communicate his Diuinity vnto vs.</p>
            <p>The ſeauenth and laſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of meditating vpon the Paſſion proceedeth from Admiration.<note place="margin">Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> This Admiration is commonly prouoked by ſome newe, ſtrange, and incredible accident. Now, there are fower thinges, which ſhew the Paſſion of our Sauiour Chriſt to bee exceeding admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Firſt, becauſe hee ſuffered, whoſe Maieſty cannot ſuffer, who is the glory and ioy of Saintes, whoſe dignity is infinite, whoſe life is eternall, &amp; whoſe Power is incomprehenſible. Secondly, becauſe hee ſuffered for them, by whom he was puniſhed, baſe men enemyes, and vngratefull perſons. Thirdly, becauſe hee ſuffered ſo
<pb facs="tcp:177899:22"/> many torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as neuer any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man indured, aſwell if you conſider the torments themſelues as alſo his ignominyes, his irriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his pouerty, and other miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of his life. Fourthly, becauſe when hee redeemed Man-kinde by his Paſſion, he vſed admirable meanes for the fulfilling thereof. For firſt, with the great weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his body hee ioyned great power, wherewith hee beat downe and ouerthrewe the Deuill the Prince of this world. Secondly, hee ioyned perfect Iuſtice with perfect Mercy: for taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion vpon man, hee ſuffered the rigour of Gods Iuſtice vpon himſelfe. Thirdly, his excellent Wiſdome ſhined foorth in that, which to men ſeemed exceeding folly: <hi>For the Croſſe of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:177899:22"/> to the</hi> Iewes <hi>is a ſcandall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and to the</hi> Gentiles <hi>folly.</hi> Great wiſdome alſo it was; Firſt, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome his moſt ſubtill enemy by Art and ſuffering, and to caſt him downe with the ſame wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, by which he had ouercome. Secondly, to deliuer vs by ſuch a kinde of puniſhment, in which he might lay vp for vs a medicine for all diſeaſes, and ſet before our eyes an example of all vertues, and kindle the flames of Loue in vs. For nothing doth ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite vs, either to the imitation of Chriſt, or to the loue of God, as this bitter Paſſion of our Lord. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken of affections.</p>
            <p>Now that wee may vſe theſe Meditations with fruit &amp; profit for the ſaluation of our ſoules,
<pb facs="tcp:177899:23"/> theſe few thinges ought to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. Firſt, that wee come not vnprepared to meditate, but (as the wiſe man aduiſeth vs) <hi>Let vs prepare our ſoule before prayer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 18.</note> Which preparation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in this, that laying away all will to ſinne, wee commit our ſelues wholy into the handes of God, and put out of our minde all externall cares and cogitations, and pray vnto Chriſt very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for his grace, that we may obtaine wholſome fruite by this meditation. Secondly, that firſt of all wee read the Euangelicall text of that Meditation; &amp; then th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> meditation it ſelfe either in whole or in part. Thirdly, that we lay aſide the booke, and repeat in our memory, what wee haue read; and conſider what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:177899:23"/> may bee ſtirred vp thereby, and labouring to excite, and moue them in our ſelues. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we breake forth into ſome ſpeach and prayer vnto God, through that affection, which is now ſtirred vp in vs; and that we either praiſe, or admire God, or pray for the forgiuenes of our ſins, or for ſome other benefite: or (to bee briefe) that we ſpeake thoſe thinges, which our minde ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſhall dictate vnto vs. It will profit vs alſo to begin firſt at the beginning of theſe Meditations; both becauſe we ſhall better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Hiſtory of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and alſo that by little and little we may proceed from the leſſer to the greater.</p>
            <p>Alſo to the end that theſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations may bee more gratefull
<pb facs="tcp:177899:24"/> and profitable, I haue incerted nothing, which is not ſound and approued, becauſe the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall not diminiſh the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor be a hindrance to deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For nothing is affirmed in this Hiſtory, but what the Scriptures ſay, or the Fathers confirme, or traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vndoubtedly deliuereth. The documents the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which are ioyned to theſe meditations, are for the moſt part taken out of the auncient Fathers, or out of the later Writers, which haue written beſt of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating vpon the Paſſion of our Lord. I haue drawen out ſome Meditations of purpoſe ſomwhat long, eſpecially ſuch, as are either of great force to mooue our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or may bee vſed ſeuerally for Sermons; as namely, thoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:177899:24"/> the ſeauen words, which our Lord ſpake vpon the Croſſe. For I was deſirous in this Booke, not onely to ſet foorth the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, but alſo to helpe the Preachers themſelues, that they may teach the people profitably, and ſtirre vp their mindes with diuers Meditations.</p>
            <p>And I haue thought good to dedicate this my labour to you, my beſt beloued brethren &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, as to thoſe, whoſe peculiar inſtitute is to honour and receiue the bleſſed body of Chriſt our Lord in the moſt holy Euchariſt, and to defend the honour thereof againſt the blaſphemyes of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heritikes: that comming to Chriſt his moſt Holy table, you may (according to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of our Lord) repeate in
<pb facs="tcp:177899:25"/> your memory his Paſſion, Death and Buriall; and make your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes ſitt Sepulchers for the body of our Lord; &amp; with your mindes render vnto him praiſe, and thankeſgiuings: and to be ſhort, being inflamed with the loue of him, who gaue himſelfe wholy for you, you may likewiſe imploy your ſelues wholy in his ſeruice, and the helpe of your neighbours. To conclude, I pray you that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of this my Labour, yee will vouchſafe to offer vp your prayers to our Bleſſed Sauiour for mee, that by his grace I may bee partaker of thoſe benefites, which by his Death and Paſſion hee hath purchaſed for vs.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:177899:85"/> did not goe out of the houſe, but out of the lower roome, &amp; began to enquire ſomthing of Chriſt: that thou maiſt deuiſe and trie all waies &amp; meanes to inioy thy Lord in thy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; to obtain him throgh the workes of vertue.

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that when <hi>Peter</hi> was come againe to the fire, he beganne to ſpeake more freely with the ſeruants, to the end that he might take away all ſuſpition from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: For by his ſpeach hee was iudged to bee a <hi>Galilaean.</hi> Thou therefore who art the ſeruant of Chriſt take heede of familiarity with the wicked.

                  <p>COnſider firſt when the high Prieſt could drawe nothing worthy of death from the wordes of Chriſt, then he asked the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, who had beene of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at his Sermons, and euery one ſpake that, which they thought might helpe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, and were very earneſt and deſirous to finde out ſome capitall crime, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying: <hi>They

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that <hi>Herod</hi> though he ſawe nothing worthy of death in Chriſt, yet he did not deliuer the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent out of the handes of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> but to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Prieſts, and the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, hee referred the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the cauſe to <hi>Pilate.</hi> In like manner euery one deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to pleaſe man, but none to pleaſe Chriſt.

Thou ſeeſt firſt, that the people
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:177899:135"/> could not be ſatisfied, but with the bloud of Chriſt: both becauſe euill men are deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely in ſinnes, which drawe bloud from our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and alſo becauſe iuſt men haue no ſweetnes but through the bloud of our Lord; nor any reioycing,<note place="margin">Galat. 6.</note> but in the Croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider fiftly, when <hi>Pilate</hi> thoght of the deliuering of our Lord after this manner, then hee remembred a more milde way. For he ſawe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſembled together, that according to their cuſtome one of the priſoners ſhould be giuen vnto them, whome they ſhould chooſe out of many, which the Preſident ſhould propound vnto them, of what crime ſoeuer they were accuſed, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the people of Iſraell, which about that time of Paſch were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, that if neuertheleſſe they perſiſted in their fury, this whipping ſhould goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his crucifying.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:177899:147"/> which cleaued to his wounds, and were ſpotted with bloud, and hurt his ſoares.

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:177899:194"/> that by theſe euills, foretold vnto women, who had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded leſſe, men might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the like at the leaſt ſhould happen vnto them. 3.

Conſider ſecondly, why thy Lord choſe this death of the Croſſe for thy ſaluation, and no other death. There are many cauſes
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:177899:203"/> thereof. Firſt, becauſe there was no death more long, more grieuous, more ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, nor more proper and fit for the procuring of thy ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For hee would not haue his body deuided; that the Church his myſticall body might bee preſerued whole: He would not be burnt, with any other fire, then the fire of charity: Hee would not bee ſtrangled with a halter, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with water, or ſmothered with earth, leaſt hee might ſeeme to haue retained ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to himſelfe, and not to haue ſhed all his bloud moſt liberally for thy ſake. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that being lift vp on high, like an hoaſt, hee might place himſelfe, as a Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:177899:204"/> God the Father and mankinde, <hi>Being the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of God and men,</hi>

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might ſee thee with his eyes a farre off, drawe thee vnto him with the chaines of his bloud, receiue thee at thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with his armes ſpred, ſhewe thee his inward partes, and hide thee in his woundes, binde thee vnto him with the linkes of charity, haue thee, ingrauen in his handes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before his eyes, keepe thee imprinted in his heart, and with his feete faſtened to

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:177899:205"/> hee would be conuerſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſinners, &amp; be alwayes ready to aſſiſt them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they call for helpe, and neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them as long as they liue. Conſider ſecondly, that hee choſe to dy amongſt theeues, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Firſt, that whereas theft is a moſt grieuous ſin, which both offendeth God, whoſe image it taketh away, and alſo hurteth our neighbour, whom it depriueth both of goods and life, he might ſignifie that there is no offence ſo great, which is not cleanſed by this his death, nor any man ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which may not obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes. Secondly becauſe euery ſinner is a thiefe and a robber, which by his

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:177899:207"/> that hee ſuffered this death of the Croſſe, not as a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but as a Sauiour, adorned with all vertues, that he might rule thy ſoule, and that thou ſhouldeſt ſubmit thy ſelfe to be wholy gouerned by him, who being nayled both hand and foote, cannot hurt his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued people, but offereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſaluation from his open woundes. Secondly, to let thee vnderſtand, what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize are offered to thee to be ſolde out of this ſhop of his Croſſe. For all houſes and ſhops haue commonly their ſignes. Heere then thou mayſt finde all ſaluation in <hi>Ieſus,</hi> all flowers of vertue in <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> and all ſecurity in the King. Runne thou hither in all
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:177899:208"/> thy neceſſityes,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.</note> and buy, and take what thou liſt, without money, or any other excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, for this marchant requireth nothing of thee, but thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and thy loue. Thirdly, that thou mayeſt know by the Table ſet before the houſe, what doctrine and Artes are read &amp; taught in this ſchoole. For Schoole maiſters vſe to write before their gates, what things are taught within their houſes. Heere thou mayeſt learne to bee ſaued, to follow all vertues, to rule thy ſelfe, to conquer thy enemyes, to gouerne wiſely others, that be vnder thy charge. Our Mr. Chriſt doth now teach from the chayre of his Croſſe, euen as hee taught being an Infant
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:177899:208"/> in the manger of the Stable. But thou perhaps deſireſt an eaſier chaire. But ſuch doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is not taught, hut out of ſuch a chaire: for there is no way to ſaluation, but by the croſſe and by many tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the habits of vertues are obtained by painfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If thou wilt rule thy ſelfe perfectly and ſubdue thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the world, the fleſh, and the Deuill; thou ſhalt not ſeeke after the eaſe of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but thou ſhalt bee ſeuere againſt thy body, and pull it out of the power of the Deuill by faſting, watching, workes of humility, contempt, &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, according to the example of this Maiſter, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou bee able to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:177899:209"/> gouern others rightly, if thou relyeſt onely vpon thy power and authority; except accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this leſſon of Chriſt thy teacher, thou doeſt out of the very bowels of thy chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, apply thy ſelfe wholy and all thinges in thee to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and good of thy ſubiects. Fourthly, that by this tytle thou mayeſt feele, of what force the ſign of the Croſſe is, which thou makeſt with thy handes. For it is not a iugling tricke, or a flye flappe, as the blaſpheming enemies of the croſſe doe tearme it: But it is the vertue &amp; power of Chriſt, for the ſafety of all beleeuers; that thou being ſigned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, mayſt be knowne by thy badge to bee the ſeruant of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:177899:209"/> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> thy King; and be a terror to the Deuil; and haue entraunce into the houſe of Chriſt, and that all thy actions may tend to the glory of God and to thy owne ſaluation. Conſider ſecondly, that this Tytle was written in diuers languages. Firſt, becauſe it concernes all men to knowe this King; and therefore it was ſet in a high place, that thou mayeſt beholde it a farre off, ſtand ſtill, read, vnderſtand and follow this King, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all other maiſters, whom thou haſt hitherto ſerued. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the crucified <hi>Meſſias</hi> is to bee knowne and praiſed in all Languages. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thirdly, the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the writing. A part of this Tytle
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:177899:210"/> being preſerued with great deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtians at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Church of the Holy Croſſe in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs: Firſt, that the Title was of wood; Secondly not written with a pen, but grauen with iron; Thirdly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Hebrue</hi> was firſt, then the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and laſtly the <hi>Latine;</hi> Fourthly, that the Greeke and Latine was written like the Hebrue from the right hand to the left.</p>
                  <p>.SVNERAZANEI</p>
                  <p>ALL which thinges are not without their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. For firſt theſe three languages onely were ſet vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Croſſe, which
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:177899:210"/> were moſt vſuall at that time, and ſo continue vntill this day: the <hi>Hebrue</hi> for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> for the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Church, and the <hi>Latine</hi> for the <hi>Weſt.</hi> For ſeeing that all Learning is written in theſe tongues, the Scriptures in <hi>Hebrue,</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, &amp; Rethoricke in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine;</hi> Chriſt taught vs hereby, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is neither any diuine knowledge, nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning and eloquence of any force, except it bee ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the bloud of Chriſt, and referred to the glory of him crucified. And therefore the holy Church vſeth theſe languages onely in her diuine ſeruice, as the moſt common, and thoſe that are conſecrated with the bloud of our Lord.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:177899:211"/> Secondly, the tytle was ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, becauſe it ſhould laſt for euer; and in wood, becauſe by the wood he ſhall alwayes raigne ouer them, whome the wood had ouerthrown. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Hebrue was firſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which the reſt doe imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: For our ſaluation is from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to whoſe diuine Scriptures all humane wiſdome is to bee directed. Fourthly, they are written from the left hand to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right, to ſignifie, that if thou deſireſt to be exalted by wiſdom with Chriſt, thou muſt humble thy ſelfe, and not be proud in thy owne conceipt. <hi>For knowledge puffeth vp,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Corr. Iac. 3.8.</note> &amp; wiſedome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt is earthly, carnall, and diabolicall. Fiftly, the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:177899:211"/> Greeke is before the Latine: for firſt the Grecians, and then the Latines were conuerted to the faith, and leauing the manners and cuſtoms of their fore-fathers, followed that doctrine, which God gaue to the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,: that thou ſhouldeſt not rely vpon thine owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but follow them with thy whole heart, whome thou knoweſt to be the ſeruants of God. Pray our Lord to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue this tytle in thy heart.</p>

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that Chriſt, to whome all iudgement
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:177899:224"/> is giuen, and whome his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes had offended, did not take vpon him the office of a Iudge, or an accuſer, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a defender &amp; patrone. The <hi>Iewes</hi> ſought how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, and found nothing worthy of accuſation in him. Our innocent Lord, that was offended, ſeeketh how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the offence; and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the offence was ſuch, that nothing could be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the extenuating ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but onely ignorance. And yet this ignorance, being vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, could no more excuſe the <hi>Iewes,</hi> then him, who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly hideth his eyes, becauſe he will not ſee him, whom he ſtriketh, or killeth. If Chriſt then in the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:177899:224"/> midſt of his torments mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth the ſinnes of his tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, will hee not now before his Father excuſe their ſinnes, who call vpon his name with faith, deuotion, and ſorrow for their ſinnes? Conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Father anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his Sonne by worde; and yet Chriſt was heard for his reuerence.<note place="margin">Heb. 5</note> For God when he denyed his Sonnes requeſt, anſwered in the garden by an Angell: but, when hee graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, hee anſwered not in worde, but in deede.<note place="margin">Ioan. 19.</note> For firſt hee reſtrained all creatures fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> riſing againſt his enemies in reuenge of his death, all which would haue fought for their creator, if this prayer of Chriſt had not ſtayed them.
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:177899:225"/> Secondly, hee reduced one of the Theeues vnto pennance. Thirdly, at the death of his Sonne he changed the minde of the Centurion, and others. Fourthly, vpon the ſolemnity of Penticoſt hee conuerted ſometimes three, &amp; ſomtimes fiue thouſand of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame <hi>Iewes</hi> vnto his faith. Therefore God the Father not by outward words, but by inward conſent anſwered his Sonne in this manner: O my Sonne, I grant that, which thou requireſt, &amp; laying aſide all wrath, I open the fountaines of mercy, and I offer grace, and pardon of ſinnes, Iuſtice, and adoption of children, as wel vnto theſe, who haue afflicted thee, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto all the Nations of the

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:177899:241"/> into Hell. Learne hereby, that commonly hee, which liueth ill, dyeth ill, as he liued ill, except he be changed by Gods ſpeciall grace. For a ſinner is ſtricken with his iudgement,<note place="margin">Aug. ſer. 3 de num.</note> that dying he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth himſelfe, who liuing was forgetfull of God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſecondly the wordes of the euill Theefe <hi>(If thou art Chriſt ſaue thy ſelfe and vs:)</hi> Firſt he wanted faith, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a miracle that hee might beleeue. Secondly, he deſired temporall life and ſafety, after the manner of all ſinners, who haue no care of their euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life to come. Thirdly, he ſpake this perhaps to pleaſe the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which ſtood by: but it profited him nothing, to get
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:177899:242"/> their fauour; becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world euer giueth a falſe reward to her followers. Fourthly hee once vttered this rayling ſpeach, but being rebuked he held his peace; being better then thy ſelfe, who art neither amended by good admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor well pleaſed with him that aduiſeth thee. Conſider thirdly, the mercy of Chriſt in the good. Theefe, whoſe heart hee did not onely inſtruct by outward ſignes, but alſo did mollifie it by inward grace, ſo as he profited more in three houres by hearing him teach from the chayre of the Croſſe, then the Apoſtles did in three yeares by following our Lord continually, and ſeeing his miracles. For ſo great is the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:177899:242"/> force of the croſſe of our Lord that it doth nor onely mooue the ſence, but alſo giueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the hearing, and addeth affection to the vnderſtanding. Therfore this good theefe being depriued of all outward thinges, and hauing his body ſtretched vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe, gaue openly all that was left vnto him, to wit, hee conſecrated his heart and tongue vnto Chriſt.

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:177899:243"/> great charity hee rebuked his companion, when he ſinned, before hee craued any thing for himſelfe of our Lord; and hee putteth him in minde of his iminent death, for ſinners ought to be repreſſed with the feare of Hell, when they will not be moued with Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites. <hi>(Neither doeſt thou feare God?)</hi> a bolde worde, but worthy of a Martyr. None of theſe (ſaith hee) feare God; and dareſt thou imitate them, being now preſently to goe before God thy Iudge? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he confeſſeth his ſinne and receiueth the puniſhment of the Croſſe in ſatisfaction. For it is a ſigne of a good man to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe his own faults, &amp; to extenuate the ſinnes of other
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:177899:243"/> men, if hee can.

But becauſe he did no ſinne, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ought to beare the ſinnes of all men, and ſuffer the puniſhment thereof in his body.

                     <pb n="446" facs="tcp:177899:248"/> for them by this thy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that if perhaps any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the laſt inſtant of his death will conuert himſelfe, hee may by thy example con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hope of pardon. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſinne, wee ought to ſet before our eyes the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſinners ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Croſſe of our Lord, and yet obtaining no pardon, leaſt our Lord perhaps leaue vs, and wee periſh amongſt them: for hee, who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed pardon to the penitent, hath not promiſed repentance to the ſinner. But after our ſinne wee muſt remember the Theefe, leaſt wee diſpaire. <hi>(This day,)</hi> preſently after thy death, that thou mayeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the vertue of the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:177899:248"/> Croſſe. For euen as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour carryeth his noble ſpoyles in tryumph to ſhewe the greatnes of his victory, ſo Chriſt, hauing gotten the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ouer the Deuill, tooke this notable prey from him, and carryed away the ſpoyle, and lead this Theefe with him into triumph, who had before been a moſt faithfull ſlaue to the Deuill. <hi>(With mee,)</hi> that thou, which haſt beene part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with mee in my paines, mayeſt not be depriued of my Crowne: and that thou mayſt not ſeeme to haue ſuffred as a theefe, but to haue triumphed as a Martyr with mee. Thus Chriſt conuerted the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Theefe into Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome; ſo as he which was
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:177899:249"/> brought as a Theefe vnto the Croſſe, did by this his notable and publike confeſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Crowne of his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 4 deami. &amp; eius origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie cap. 9.</note> as a Martyr with Chriſt the Prince of Martyrs. <hi>(Thou ſhalt bee,)</hi> to remaine for euer. <hi>(In,)</hi> the ioyes ſhall bee ſo great, that thou ſhalt not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thirdly, conſtant, and of a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, with an aſſured faith of the redemption of man, and of the reſurrection of her Sonne. Fourthly, as prepared herſelfe ro goe vp to the croſſe, and, if need were, to ſuffer death for ſinners. Conſider fiftly, that a fewe others ſtood by the croſſe with the Mother of our Lord, a Virgin, a Widdow, and a Sinner, being ſorrowful and deſtitute of all comfort: that thou mayeſt learne, Firſt, that our Lord crucified on the Croſſe was giuen vs by God the Father, to bee a comforte to the afflicted, a Patrone to Widdowes, &amp; Orphanes, and a preſeruer and protector of Virgins. Secondly, that Chriſt
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:177899:253"/> did communicate the feeling of the griefe of his Paſſion eſpecially to thoſe, whom he loued moſt dearely.

Some onely walke by it, and lightly paſſe ouer the myſteryes of Chriſt: others ſtand a farre off, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo vpon it, as if the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Croſſe did not appertaine vnto them: others ſtand by the Croſſe of the Theeues, who ſuffer the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of their pride, their ryot, their couetouſnes, &amp; of their

Fiftly, that thou mayſt vnderſtand, that the fruite of our Lords death, conſiſteth in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of the ſplendor &amp; fauour of the world: for they, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are crucified with Chriſt, reioyce not in Honors &amp; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:177899:260"/> but in obſcurity, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; contempt. Conſider 2. the manner of this Eclipſe, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> St. <hi>Dioniſius Areopagita,</hi> being an eye witnes,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 7. ad. policarpu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp; 11. ad Apolloph.</note> hath deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. 1. The Moone being at the full and oppoſite to the Sun, returned from midnight to noone. 2. It returned, not by his ordinary motion, from the Weſt; but by a contrary motion to himſelfe, from the Eaſt. Thirdly, the Sunne it ſelfe loſt his light in it ſelfe. Fourthly, not in one only part of the earth (as in other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes,) but ouer the whole world this darkneſſe of the Sunne was ſeene, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as of the Moone eclipſed, and depriued of her light by the ſhadowe of the earth
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:177899:261"/> falling vppon her. Fiftly, this eclipſe continued three whole houres, which vſually laſteth but a ſmall time. All theſe thinges are not voide of their reaſons and conſiderations. Chriſt is the Sonne of Iuſtice, the Moone is the world, and fooliſh ſinners:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 27</note> 
                     <hi>For a foole is changed like the Moone.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Lord dyed, when the world being oppoſite to God did ſhine in glory, riches, and wiſdome. The world alſo came to this eclipſe, that is, to the death of our Lord, to w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>, not onely by other ſinnes, but alſo by this ſeeking of the death of Chriſt, it had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen cauſe. But becauſe the maieſty of Chriſt is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to humane power, hee
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:177899:261"/> could neuer haue beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, &amp; put to death by the power of man, except hee had bin deliuered to death by the diuine will of God. Therfore the Sunne is truly obſcured, and Chriſt is truly ſlaine, both by the malice of the world, &amp; by his Fathers wrath. For our Lord was like vnto him, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſtandeth between two men a fighting, and receiueth both their ſwordes into his owne body. The world fighteth with God; and our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth in his body, both the wrath of God, and the fury of men. <hi>Thy wrath</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hath paſſed through me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 87.</note> 
                     <hi>and thy terrors haue troubled me.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Sun of Iuſtice was eclipſed, the Earth was
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:177899:262"/> couered with darknes; both becauſe by this grieuous ſinne there was newe matter giuen of lamentation and reuenge; and alſo becauſe by the death of our Lord all power ouer men was taken away from the Prince of the world, and in ſtead thereof he was bound in chaynes of fire, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> darke priſon of Hell. But whereas the Moone by a contrary motion came from the Eaſt to the Sunne in the South, thereby is ſignified that the <hi>Iewes</hi> without all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of equity and iuſtice, haſtened the death of Chriſt, contrary to Law, contrary to the right of nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and did violently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:177899:262"/> all good motions in themſelues. To bee briefe, the Sunne was eclipſed three houres, becauſe our Lord lay hid three whole dayes, partly in torments and in the handes of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and partly in the Sepulcher. Pray thou vnto Chriſt to preſerue the true light of faith and grace in thy ſoule.</p>

                  <p>COnſider firſt, why thy Lord at the end of his life made this crye: Certainly not to eſcape the paines; like vnto vs,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:177899:263"/> who crye out, aſſoone as wee feele any paine; for now the end of his paine approached: nor to bee reuenged on the <hi>Iewes</hi> for this his death; for the bloud of Chriſt ſpeaketh better then the bloud of <hi>Abell.</hi> But firſt, that hee, who by the ſpace of three houres, being couered with darknes, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen no ſigne of life neither by worde nor groane, might be knowne to bee ſtill aliue. Doe thou conſider with thy ſelfe what hee did all the time of his ſilence in the midſt of his torments: ſurely hee pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ceaſing vnto God for thee in that admirable ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie and ſacrifice; and hee rehearſed the holy wordes of the Pſalmes for thy ſaluation,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:177899:263"/> ſpeaking ſome with a loude voyce, that he might be heard of the ſtanders by. Secondly, leaſt by the continuall ſilence of Chriſt, and his admirable patience, and conſtancy of minde, hee might erroneouſly be thought to be but a viſion and no man, and not to haue felt any paine at all. For hee did truly ſuffer &amp; feele paines; but the loue of thee reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him from complaining.

Fourthly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt learne by this loud voyce to obtaine of God the Father through Chriſt the fruite of his Paſſion.

<pb n="484" facs="tcp:177899:267"/> that the impiety of wicked men may bee reſtrained for a time, but cannot be quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, without the ſpeciall fauour of God. Secondly, to obſerue diligently and feare the miracles and thratenings of God. For euen as God by this darknes did foreſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Iewes</hi> the iminent dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wherin for euer they ſhall remaine, except they repent; ſo by his threatning ſignes, by comets, thunder, earthquakes peſtilence, famine, and other ſtrange thinges and euents, he foreſheweth the calamity and miſchiefe to come.

Conſider fourthly, what comfort is brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world; to wit, mocking, and contempt; for how can they comfort others, which want true comfort of minde themſelues? Conſider fiftly, that theſe wordes were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them, which ſtood by, and heard: that thou mayeſt learne, Firſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idle men, which are not occupied in their own affaires, doe nothing but carp and ſcoffe at the wordes and

Secondly that ſuch wreſt Gods wordes, to an euill ſence, which onely heare them, and doe not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their time to the ſtudy of vertue.

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that our Lord in all theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Croſſe, did neuertheleſſe in his minde reuolue the Scriptures, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently view them all, leaſt perhaps there might bee ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them vnfulfilled for thy ſaluation: that thou like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

Conſider thirdly, that this thirſt was moſt grieuous; which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> foreſawe ſo many ages before; which grewe both from the labours and torments of the Croſſe,

<pb n="490" facs="tcp:177899:270"/> from the decaying of his ſtrength, and from the loſſe of all naturall moiſture; that our Lord might declare vnto vs, that hee had with a liberall hand beſtowed all his benefits vpon vs. Conſider fiftly, why being inwrapped &amp; compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſo many torments &amp; paines on euery ſide, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained onely of thirſt. Firſt, to ſhow, that he did truly and ſharply feele the torments of the Croſſe: for Chriſt vſeth not to complaine lightly, but onely in matter of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secondly, to commend temperance by his example a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other vertues, which doth both lift vp the minde to God, and bringeth a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine remedy for ſinnes. 3.
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:177899:270"/> That hee, which had ſhed all his bloud for vs, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs all his goods, and had prayed for the ſinnes of all men to his Father, might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what ſign of a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde men would ſhew vnto him, when he was ready to depart out of the world. I deſire yee not (ſaith hee) to take me from the Croſſe, nor to giue me my cloathes to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my nakednes, nor to heale my woundes; but onely to giue me one drop of water to quench my thirſt, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed onely to the damned in Hell: I deſire yee onely to refreſh my drynes: I require this fauour only of you for all my labours. Fourthly, that he might be vnderſtood to ſpeak
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:177899:271"/> not of his bodily onely, but ſpecially of his ſpirituall thirſt.

Was this the reward of that mouth, which opened ſo often for our ſaluation, and of that tongue, which gaue vs ſo many good leſſons, cured ſo many diſeaſed, &amp; wrought ſo many myracles?

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as Chriſt ſpake for himſelfe vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:177899:287"/> hee cryed with a loude voyce; but when he ſpake to others, or for others, hee vſed a lower voyce, to teach thee, Firſt, that thou muſt alwayes deale with God with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. To others thou ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thy griefes with teares, but when thou ſpeakeſt with God, thou art ſo drye, that thou haſt ſcarce any feeling of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Secondly, what grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous paines the Son of God ſuffered, who with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence thereof was forced to crye out. Conſider ſecondly, that Chriſt for diuers cauſes cryed out in his prayers, when hee was ready to dye.<note place="margin">Ioan. 11.</note> Firſt, to ſhew that he was Lord of life and death; hauing power to yeeld vp his ſoule, and to take
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:177899:287"/> it againe, at his owne will and pleaſure. Therfore hee called for death (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith) which durſt not come,<note place="margin">In Chriſto patiente.</note> except it had been called. Secondly, to mooue God the Father to mercy: For ſeeing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, being oppreſſed with grieuous ſinnes, was farre off from God, hee, who carryed the perſon of all men, ought to cal vpon God with a loude voyce, being ſo farre abſent. Doe thou therefore knock at our Lords eares, not ſo much with loudnes of voice, as with affection of hart. Thirdly, that this voice, being ſent through the whole world, might moue mens hearts, and that hearing of the death of God for their ſinnes, they might be penitent
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:177899:288"/> for their offences. For at this voyce the Earth was ſhaken, the Rockes were cleft in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Monuments were opened; that thy ſtony heart might alſo be broken by the force of this worde of God. Not without cauſe did <hi>Marke</hi> ſay, <hi>(his voyce being ſent forth)</hi> that thou ſhouldſt vnderſtand that being ſent into the world it worketh ſtill in the heartes of men. Fourthly, that Hell ſhould tremble at this voyce: and euen as at the crye of our Lord, calling <hi>Lazarus,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> returned without delay into his body; ſo now euery one there ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe to receiue their Lord, being ready inſtantly to come vnto them. The holy
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:177899:288"/> Fathers therefore in <hi>Limbo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced at this voyce: and the Deuils in Hell trembled. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to teach thee how to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on death, not remiſly, or negligently, as of a thing little pertaining to thee; nor ſlowly and dully, as of a thing a farre off; but often and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, &amp; of a thing moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and at hand, &amp; ſo much the more feruently, becauſe it is the onely gate to ſaluation. Conſider thirdly, that in the ninth houre our Lord brake forth into this clamor: in the houre (I ſay) of prayer, and of the euening Sacrifice. For then the true hoaſt was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed vpon the Croſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cutt into two partes, that is, into body and ſoule, was
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:177899:289"/> immolated to God the Father by the high Prieſt with a loud voyce and great labour. Ioyne thou thy prayers with Chriſt his prayer, that with his voice they may pierce the Fathers eares.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Luc. 23.</note>O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.</head>
                  <p>COnſider firſt, that Chriſt prayed not vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vppon the Croſſe, but in the wordes of the Scripture. Firſt, becauſe hee knewe, that theſe wordes were moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to his Father, beeing written by the holy Ghoſt, to teach vs to pray. Secondly, to teach thee to worſhip God not according to thy owne faſhion &amp; vnderſtanding, but in ſuch manner, as the Church
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:177899:289"/> indued with the holy Ghoſt hath appointed thee. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſecondly, that Chriſt vſed this word, <hi>Father,</hi> onely twiſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Croſſe, in his firſt, &amp; in his laſt prayer, but in his mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that is, in his fourth pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hee called him not Father, but, God. Firſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt like a Son, willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that puniſhment, which thy Father ſendeth, and in thy puniſhment confeſſe thy own baſenes, who art not worthy to bee called the ſon of God, and like a poore creature call vpon God thy Creator (for tribulation and aduerſity doe teach good men their owne fraile eſtate, and vnworthines, and thereby perſwade, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inforce them to mend
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:177899:290"/> their liues,) &amp; that in the end, hauing ouercome all aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thou ſhouldeſt take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage &amp; reioyce as a Son: <hi>For probation worketh hope,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>which confoundeth not.</hi> Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the beginnings of Gods word doe moſt ſweetly affect the minde; the progreſſe is hard to ſenſuality; but the fruites which are gathered, are moſt pleaſaunt. The booke was in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of <hi>Iohn</hi> ſweete as hony,<note place="margin">Apoc. 10.</note> but being deuoured it made his belly bitter. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe in his firſt prayer, when hee prayed for ſinners, hee was to gaine authority to his prayer through the loue of a Sonne, for none but a ſonne could bee heard for ſo great wickednes: In the middle, he
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:177899:290"/> complained as a man: And in this laſt, hauing fulfilled his embaſſage, he deſires as a Son to bee called home to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Conſider thirdly, that Chriſt made this petition to his Father, not for feare of iudgment, for now his Father had committed all iudgement to him; nor for feare of the Deuill, whoſe forces hee had already broken; nor for feare of the paines of Hell, which now hee came to take from good men, and to carry away the ſpoyles of Hell. But firſt, to teach thee, neuer to remit or ſlacke thy inuincible ſpirit from prayer. Secondly, that thou ſhouldeſt knowe, with what confidence he went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father. For hee ſayeth
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:177899:291"/> not anxiouſly after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of a ſuppliant, I pray thee, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as it were of mine owne right and authority, I commend my ſpirit. Conſider fourthly, &amp; marke euery word of this laſt prayer, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had bin made by the holy Ghoſt to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.</note> and is now recited by the Son to the Father, with addition onely of this word, Father. <hi>Father:</hi> Firſt, I haue remained thy Son in all theſe ſo great torments, I haue remitted nothing of my deuotion, &amp; loue to thee. Secondly, I thy Sonne am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to thee from this hard embaſſage, from this bloudy battell I carry away the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and I bring the ſpoyles. What reward wilt thou giue
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:177899:291"/> me, what glory wilt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for mee, what triumph wilt thou aſſigne mee? The Roman Emperors triumphed with the victorious Army. Poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes from the rich mans table, was carryed in a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Chariot, that is, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels hands into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. What glory then wilt thou giue to me thy Sonne? I am more honorable, becauſe I am thy Son: I haue labored more then the reſt, for I haue ſpent my bloud; I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone more danger, for I haue fought alone with the enemy; I haue indured more want, for a drop of water hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed mee; I haue ouercome more ſtrange enemyes, for I
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:177899:292"/> haue ſubdued the Prince of this world, broken his forces, and thruſt him out of poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to bee briefe, I haue taken more noble ſpoyles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deliuered ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſoules from the bondage of the Deuill, and ſubdued all the whole world vnto thy gouerment. What then wilt thou prepare for ſo great a conqueror? <hi>Into thy handes:</hi> Firſt, as ſacrifices are offered into the handes of God, ſo I, as high Prieſt, doe offer my ſoule, as a moſt fatt ſacrifice into thy handes. Secondly, hitherto the ſoules, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of this world, went not into the handes of God, but into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome in the places belowe: but now I
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:177899:292"/> deſire firſt to be receiued into thy handes, and my Diſciples hereafter to bee receiued alſo. Thirdly, this my ſpirit, which is now deſcending into Hell, to deliuer the Fathers, ſhall not want the diuinity; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the diuine nature took the humane nature into the ſame perſon, ſo it ſhall remain both with the body in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, &amp; with the ſpirit in Hell. Fourthly, I commend it to thy hands; that thou ſhouldeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe it with glory, &amp; adorne it with rewardes. <hi>I commend,</hi> or as the Greeke text ſaieth, <hi>I will commend,</hi> that is, euen now I will ſend it to thee. Firſt, hitherto neither this body, nor my ſoule hath ſeemed to bee greatly commended vnto
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:177899:293"/> thee, becauſe both the body hath remained in the hands of enemies, and my ſoule being ſorrowfull euen vnto death, was alwaies in my own hands ſubiect to many miſeries,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.</note> and death it ſelfe. Hitherto thou haſt ſeemed to haue care only of thy bondſlaues, and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thy Sonne: for thou haſt deliuered vp thy Sonne, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thy ſeruant: doe thou now at laſt receiue my ſpirit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto thee. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I commend, that is, I leaue it with thee, to haue it againe after three dayes. Thirdly, no man taketh it from mee, for I am not compelled to dye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will; but I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeild it, and deliuer it to thy cuſtody. <hi>My ſpirit,</hi> hee ſaith
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:177899:293"/> not my ſoule, which beaſtes poſſeſſe aſwell as men, but, my ſpirit, becauſe the ſenſual man (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that though the ſpirit of Chriſt nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to be commended to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father, yet it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended

He had giuen his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he had giuen his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he had giuen his body, hee had giuen his bloud: and now there remained nothing, but to giue his ſoule, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the propheſie of <hi>Iſaias,</hi>

If thou doeſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things rightly, thou ſhalt learne, firſt, not to abuſe thy ſelfe, &amp; thy goods to thy owne pleaſures; nor to ſpend them according to the will of the Deuill; no nor yet to vſe them as thine owne, but to referre all to the honour of

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that by this ſigne, being the greateſt of all other, is ſignified: Firſt, that Chriſt thy Lord, opening by his death the gates of Hel, did ſet at liberty the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there impriſoned, and brake hell-gates, ſo as neuer any Saint hereafter ſhould bee detained there. Secondly, that by the ſame death the ſtinking cloſets of our heartes are to bee opened, that all the ſtinche of ſinne and death may vapour out, and bee diſperſed. Thirdly, that the bodyes of the iuſt ſhould riſe againe, &amp; liue for euer. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſecondly, that though
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:177899:307"/> the Sepulchers were opened, yet the Saints did not riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, who is the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the dead: for, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Our Lord was deliuered vp or ſlaine,</hi>

                     <hi>for our finnes; and roſe againe for our iuſtification:</hi> That is, by his death hee hath payed the price of our ſinnes; but riſing again hee hath applyed this price vnto vs, by the preaching of the Apoſtles, by our faith of his death &amp; reſurrection, and by the Sacraments and other meanes left vnto vs after his reſurrection. Conſider third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe Saints, whether being to dye againe, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors thought, or to liue for euer with Chriſt, as many late writers doe thinke,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:177899:307"/> aſſumed their bodyes againe, and appeared to many, that they might bee true witneſſes of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord who was able as eaſily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore his ſoule to his body being lately dead; as to raiſe vp the bodyes of the Fathers being conſumed to aſhes ſo many ages before: that thou in all thy difficulties ſhouldſt haue confidence in God, to whome nothing can bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Conſider fourthly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they appeared not to all, but to many: for all are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fellowſhip of Saints. Conſider fiftly, that they came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Citty (for the dead were buryed abroad) that is, <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> ſanctified by the religion of the Temple, and
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:177899:308"/> of ſacred thinges: for nowe through Chriſt the way vnto the heauenly <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was opened vnto them.

For firſt, the vaile being broken, and the darknes of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance being driuen away, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth appeareth more plainly, the ſeuerity of the iudgement to come is ſet before our eyes and the moſt cruell and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments of Hell are ſeriouſly &amp; frequently thoght vpon.

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that by the commandement of the Law, ſuch as were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree,<note place="margin">Deut. 21</note> were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bee buryed at night, when as ſuch, as were put to death by any other meanes, were (as vnworthy of buriall) either couered with ſtones, or left to bee deuoured by beaſts.

<pb n="580" facs="tcp:177899:315"/> Secondly becauſe God in his mercy would not, that guilty perſons ſhould bee puniſhed twice for one and the ſame fault: For, becauſe <hi>euery one was accurſed which hanged on the Tree,</hi> hee ordained that at leaſt after their death they ſhould haue the honor of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.

Secondly, that according to St. <hi>Ciprian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ser. de du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirio.</note> hee might power out all the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture remaining in his body and all the bloud reſiding in his heart, and reſerue nothing to himſelfe.

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that as out of the ſide of <hi>Adam</hi> ſleeping, <hi>Eua</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; ſo out of the ſide of our Lord ſleeping, the Church ſhould bee deduced.

For he is the true Lambe; who beeing ſo
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:177899:320"/> cruelly ſacrificed, tooke away the ſinnes of the world, with whoſe fleſh thou oughteſt to ſatisfie thy ſelfe with all ſpeed and deſire. Therefore thoſe thinges, which are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the eating of the Lamb in the figure, ought alſo to bee obſerued diligently in the holy Communion. And firſt we muſt take heed, that we breake not a bone; that is, that wee ſearch not into his diuine power, nor breake our brotherly charity. For euen as the diuine nature and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie (which is ſignified in a bone) ſuffred no euil vpon the Croſſe: ſo in the Communion of this moſt holy Sacrament, nothing, concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power ought to be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

Conſider thirdly, that <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Prophet, heere cyted by the Euangeliſt, ſpake of the future comming of Chriſt to iudgement.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſecondly, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth is not named the next day after the Paraſceue: Firſt, becauſe the true ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Saboath and of the Paſch was to bee transferred to the next day by the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe holy dayes, being prophaned by ſinne, are not feaſtiuall &amp; profitable to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:177899:336"/> but rather hurtful &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.<note place="margin">Theoph. in Mat. 27.</note> Conſider 3. <hi>Maiſter,</hi> they, which refuſed the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> for their Lord and Maiſter, are worthily compelled to accept a vile Idolater for their Maiſter. For the Deuill and the world ſhall rule ouer him, ouer whom Chriſt ruleth not. Conſider fourthly, that Chriſt was called by the wicked a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer: For the Deuill euen at this day indeauoreth by his ſeruants to perſwade, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt is a Seducer, and that they are ſeduced to errors and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whom Chriſt doth either conuert to the true faith, or exhort to a better kinde of life; whereas Chriſt doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no man, but leadeth them from the wide way of
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:177899:336"/> Hell to the ſtraite and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe pathe of eternall life. Conſider fiftly, that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked feared Chriſt being dead; how much more then ought he to be feared being liuing, and comming with Maieſtie to iudge the quicke and the dead? Heere thou feeſt two kindes of the feare of God; one in the <hi>Centurion,</hi> and the reſt which went away, ſtriking their breaſts, and for feare of future euils thinking of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of their liues; the other of wicked men, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to infringe the councells of God, and this feare is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the deuill, and to all the enemies of God. Conſider ſixtly, that the great care and diligence of theſe wicked
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:177899:337"/> men did much increaſe the glory of Chriſt. For by this diligent carefulnes of them, the rumor of the foreſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt was the more publiſhed, and cauſed ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y many to hope and expect the ſame, and alſo tooke away all ſuſpition of ſtealing him away, ſeeing there was with ſuch diligence a company of ſouldiers appointed to watch him. Conſider ſeauenthly, that they feared, leaſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt ſhould ſteale away his bodie. Doe thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it openly, for it is giuen to thee, borne for thee, and crucified for thee: and pray our Lord neither to depart from thee himſelfe, nor to ſuffer any creature els to take him from thee.</p>

                  <p>COnſider firſt that <hi>Pilate,</hi> who had once conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Iewes</hi> to the death of Chriſt, did now aſſigne them a guard, to wit, the Garriſon ſoldiours, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the watching of the Cittie. For whoſoeuer doth once yeild to the will of the wicked, ſhall hardly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe after from their will and importunity; wherof they haue experience, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelues with the vnlawfull loue of women: and the Deuill alſo, hauing once got the vpper hand; bringeth men into miſerable bondage. Conſider ſecondly, that <hi>Pilate</hi>
                     <pb n="626" facs="tcp:177899:338"/> who before had diligently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the cauſe of Chriſt, doth now conſpire with the <hi>Iewes</hi> againſt the glorie of Chriſt. <hi>Goe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>keepe him, as ye knowe;</hi> that is, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in watching him: for a man doth ſo eaſily fall out of one ſinne into another, that he alſo becommeth an author and prouoker of ſin in others. Conſider thirdly, that <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he heard mention made of his reſurrection, waxed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, both of the inconſtant people, and alſo of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> without whoſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had condemned an innocent man to death. For this is the fruite of ſinne, that it bringeth feare, care, and diſquiet of minde. Therefore

                  <p>COnſider firſt, the diligent watching of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. For Firſt, they marked the ſtone with a ſeale, leaſt the Souldiers ſhould vſe any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie or deceipt. Secondly, they appointed a Garde, that is, a ſufficient number of Soldiours, both becauſe the fauourers of Chriſt ſhould be able to offer no violence, and alſo leaſt a fewe might fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, and in the meane time, be ſtolen away.
