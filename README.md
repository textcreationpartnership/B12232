1. ✚ IHS. Of the Paſsion of our Lord.

    _ The firſt Meditation of his going out of the houſe from ſupper.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The ſecond Meditation of his entrie into the Garden.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The third Meditation of the great perplexitie of Chriſt in the Garden.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The fourth Meditation of the firſt prayer of Chriſt.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The fift Meditation of the ſecond & third prayer of Chriſt.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The ſixt Meditation of his agony, & bloody ſweate.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The eight Meditation of the falling of the Iewes to the earth.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The tenth Meditation of the eare of Malchus being cut off

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The eleuenth Meditation of the captiuity of our Lord.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The twelfe Meditation of the acts in Annas houſe, and his ſending to Caiphas.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 13. Meditation of the blow in the houſe of Chayphas.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 14. Meditation of the denying of Peter.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

    _ The 15. Meditation of the falſe witneſſes in the houſe of Caiphas.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 16. Meditation of the firſt condemnatiō of Chriſt and of his mocking.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 18. Meditation of the death of Iudas.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 19. Meditation of the firſt accuſation of our Lord before Pilate.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 20. Meditation of the examination of Pilate.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 21. Meditation of the ſecond accuſation before Pilate.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 22. Meditation of the acts in the houſe of Herode.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 23. Meditation of the requiring of Barrabas.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 25. Meditation of the Crowning of our Lord.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 26. Meditation of Pilate his bringing foorth of our Lord to the People.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 27. Meditation of the third accuſation of our Lord before Pilate.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 28. Meditation of the ſecond examination of Chriſt made by Pilate.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 29. Meditation of the fourth accuſation of Chriſt before Pilate.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 30. Meditation of the condemnation of Chriſt.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 31. Meditation of the carrying of the Croſſe.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 32. Meditation of the Women following Chriſt.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 33. Meditation of the crucifying of our Lord.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 34. Meditation of the Title of the Croſſe.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 35. Meditation of the firſt word of Chriſt

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 36. Meditation of the diuiſion of his Garments.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 37. Meditation of his mocking vpon the Croſſe.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 38. Meditation of the ſecond worde of Chriſt.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 39. Meditation of the third worde on the Croſſe.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 40. Meditation of the fourth word on the Croſſe.Mat. 27. Mar. 15.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 41. Meditation of the fift worde of Chriſt on the Croſſe.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 42. Meditation of the ſixt word of our Lord on the Croſſe.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 44. Meditation of the death of Chriſt.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 45. Meditation of the ſignes in the death of Chriſt.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 46. Meditation of the conuerſion of the Centurion.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 49. Meditation of the buriall of our Lord.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.

    _ The 50. Meditation of the keeping of the Sepulcher.

      * The Hymne being ſaid Ieſus went foorth beyond the torrent Cedron according to his custome,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 18. and his diſciples followed him.

      * Then he ſaid to his Diſciples all yee ſhall ſuffer ſcandall in me in this night.Mat. 26. For it is written, I will ſtrike the Shepheard and the Sheepe of the flocke ſhalbe ſcattered:Mar. 14. but after I ſhall riſe againe I will goe before you into Galilee.

      * And Peter anſwearing ſaid vnto him,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. although all ſhall be ſcandalized in thee I will neuer be ſcandalized: Ieſus ſaid vnto him Amen, I ſay vnto thee, O Peter, that in this night before the Cocke ſhall twiſe giue foorth his voyce, thou ſhalt deny me
 thriſe: Peter ſaid vnto him, although it behoued me to dye with thee I will not deny thee: and al the diſciples ſaid the like.

      * Then came Ieſus with them into a village which is called Gethſemani,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Ioan. 18. where was a garden, into which he entered and his diſciples.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Then he ſaid vnto his Diſciples, ſit heere, whilſt I goe yonder and pray, pray yee leaſt yee enter into temptation.

      * And he tooke Peter, & Iames, and Iohn with him.Mar. 14.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he began to feare, to waxe weary, to be ſorrowfull, and to be ſad.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And he ſaid vnto them, my ſoule is ſorrowfull euen vnto death.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.Stay yee heere and watch with me, and he was drawne away from them, and he went as farre as the caſt of a ſtone.

      * And kneeling downe hee fell on his face vpon the ground, and prayed,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. if it might bee, that, that houre might paſſe from him: Saying, O my Father, if it may bee, let this cup paſſe from me: but yet not as I will, but as thou wilt.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22.And when he was riſen, from his prayers, hee came to his diſciples,
 and found them ſleeping, and hee ſaid to Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldeſt thou not watch one houre with mee?

      * Why doe you ſleepe? watch and pray,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. leaſt ye enter into tēptation, the ſpirit truely is ready, but the fleſh is weake.

      * He went away again the ſecond time, & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc 22. Abba father all things are poſſible vnto thee: if thou wilt, transferre this cup from me, but yet not mine, but thy will be done.

      * And he came againe & found them ſleeping,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for their eyes were very heauy, and they knewe not what to anſweare him, and leauing them he went away again.

      * And hee prayed the third time,Mat. 26. & prayed the ſame ſpeach, ſaying, O my Father, if this cup cannot paſſe from me, but
 that I mmſt drinke thereof, thy will be done.

      * And there appeared vnto him an Angel frō heauen, cōforting him.Luc. 22.

      * Luc. 22.And being in an agony, hee prayed longer.

      * And his ſweat was made like droppes of bloud,Luc. 22. running downe to the ground.

      * And he came the third time, and ſaid vnto them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſleepe now, and reſt, it ſufficeth: the houre is come: Behold the Sonne of man ſhall bee deliuered into the handes of ſinners, ariſe, let vs goe: behold he, that ſhall betray me, is hard by.

      * As hee was yet ſpeaking, beholde Iudas one of the twelue came: And Iudas,Mat. 26. Ioan. 18 which betrayed him, knewe the place, becauſe Ieſus had come thither often with his Diſciples.

      * Therfore Iudas,Ioan. 18. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. when he had receiued, his company & the miniſters, from the Prieſts & Phariſes: hee came thith r with lanthornes & torches, with ſwordes and ſtaues & armour, ſent from the chiefe Prieſts & Seniors of the people, and hee, which was called Iudas, went before him.

      * Ieſus therefore knowing all things which ſhould come vpon him, went forward, and ſaid, whome ſeeke yee? they anſweared him, Ieſus of Nazareth.

      * Ioan. 18.Ieſus anſweared them: I am he: and Iudas, who betrayed him, ſtood with them: Therefore as he ſaid vnto them I am he,
 they went backward, and fell vpon the ground.

      * Therefore hee asked them againe: whom ſeeke yee? they ſay vnto him, Ieſus of Nazareth: he ſaith vnto them: I haue told you that I am hee: If therefore yee ſeeke mee, ſuffer theſe men to goe away, that the Speech may bee fulfilled, which ſaide: Becauſe, whome thou gaueſt vnto mee; I haue not lost any of them.

      * Mat. 26. Mar. 14.And the Traytor had giuen them a ſigne, ſaying, whome ſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, hold him, and carie him warily.

      * Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14.Iudas went before them, and drewe neare, that hee might kiſſe him, and comming preſently hee ſaid, haile Rabbi: & he kiſſed him.

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Friend wherfore art thou come?Mat. 26. Luc. 22. O Iudas, doeſt thou betray the Sonne of man with a kiſſe?

      * They which were about him, ſeeing what would come,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Ioan. 18. ſaide vnto him: Lord if wee ſtrike in the ſword? & behold one of thoſe ſtanders by, which were with Ieſus, Simō Peter, drew his ſword, and ſtriking the ſeruant of the chiefe Prieſt, cut of his right eare, & the name of the ſeruant was Malchus.

      * And Ieſus anſwering ſaid, ſuffer now:Luc 22. Then Ieſus ſaid vnto Peter, put thy ſword into thy ſcabbard:Mat. 26. For all which take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword: 2. Doeſt thou thinke that I cannot aske my Father,Ioan. 18 and hee will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels? 3. The cup which my Father hath giuen vnto me, wilt
 thou not that I ſhall drinke it? Fourthly,Ioan. 18. how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled? becauſe ſo it muſt be done.

      * And when he had touched his eare, he healed it.Luc. 22.

      * In that howre Ieſus ſaid vnto the multitude, & to thoſe,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. which came to him, the chiefe Prieſts, the Magiſtrates of the people, and the elders; yee went forth
 as to a thiefe with ſwords and ſtaues to apprehēd me: I was daily with you in the Temple, & I ſate teaching, & you did not hold me,Luc. 22. nor ſtretch your hands againſt me: But this is your houre, & the power of darkenes: And all this was done that the ſcriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled.

      * Then came the company and Tribune,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. & the Miniſters of the Iewes & laid hands vpon Ieſus, and ſo they held & bound him.

      * Then all his Diſciples leauing him fled: but a certaine young man did followe him, cloathed in linnen vpon the bare: and they layd hold of him, but he leauing his linnen fled away naked from them.

      * And they brought Ieſus firſt to Annas,Ioan. 7. for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high Prieſt of that yeare: And Caiphas was he, which gaue counſaile to the Iewes: Becauſe it is neceſſary that one man dye for the people.

      * And Annas ſent him bound to Caiphas the high Priest,Ioan. 18 Mat. 26. where the Scribes and Seniours were aſſembled.

      * And Simon Peter followed Ieſus a farre off,Ioan. 18. and another diſciple: and that diſciple was known to the high Prieſt, & entred with Ieſus into the high Prieſts court: but Peter ſtood at the gate without: Therefore the other diſciple who was known to the high Prieſt went forth & ſpake to the porter, & brought in Peter euen into the Court of the high Prieſt,Mat. 26. & being come in,Mar. 14. the fire burning in the mideſt of the Court, and they ſitting round about it,Luc. 22.Peter was in the midſt of thē, & ſate with the miniſters at the fire, that he might ſee the end, and warme him ſelfe.

      * Then the high Prieſt asked Ieſus of his Diſciples and of his Doctrine? Ieſus ſaid to him:Ioan. 18 I haue ſpoken openly to the world, I alwaies taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whether all the Iewes aſſemble, and in ſecret I haue ſpoken nothing: Why ask you mee? Aske them which heard me, what I haue ſaid vnto them, behold theſe know, what I haue ſpoken.

      * When hee had ſpoken this,Ioan. 18. one of the ſeruants gaue a blowe to Ieſus, ſaying: doeſt thou anſwere the high Prieſt ſo?

      * Ieſus anſwered vnto him, if I haue ſpoken euill,Ioan. 18. beare witnes of the euill: but if well, why doeſt thou ſtrike mee.

      * And Peter ſate abroade in the Court below,Mat. 26. whom when the Mayd portreſſe of the high Prieſt ſaw ſitting at the light,Mar. 14. and warming him,Luc 22. & had beheld him, ſhee ſaid: And this man was with him:Ioan. 18. & the mayd came vnto him, ſaying: and art not thou of the diſciples of this man? he ſaid, I am not: and he denyed before them all, ſaying: Woman
 I know not the man, neither doe I know, nor haue k•owne, what thou ſayeſt: And hee went forth before the court, and the Cocke crowed.

      * Mat. 26.But hee going out of the gate, another Mayd ſaw him, & ſaid to them,Mar. 14. which were there: And this man was with Ieſus of Nazareth,Luc. 22. and another ſeeing him ſaid: and thou art of them. But Peter ſaid, O man, I am not, and hee denyed with an oath, for I do not knowe the man.

      * ANd the ſpace as it were of an houre being paſt, another affirmed, ſaying: Verily and this man was with him; for he alſo is a Galilaean: Then they ſaid vnto him: Whether art thou one of his Diſciples? he denyed and ſaid. I am not,Ioan. 18 and they came which ſtood by, and ſaid: Verily thou alſo art one of them, for thou alſo art a Galilaean, and thy ſpeach doth make thee manifeſt: Then ſaid one of the Seruants of the High Prieſt to him, his couſin whoſe Eare Peter had cut off: Did not I ſee thee in the Garden with him? Then hee began to curſe, to deteſt, and ſweare, for I knowe not this man of whom yee ſpeake: And foorthwith as hee was yet ſpeaking the
 Cocke crowed againe:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. And our Lord turned, and beheld Peter: And Peter remembred himſelfe of the word of our Lord,Luc. 22. as hee had ſaid, that before the Cocke crowe twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe, and Peter going out of doores wept bitterly.

      * BVt the chiefe Prieſts, and all the counſaile ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. that they might put him to death, and they did not finde it, wheras many falſe witneſſes were come in. For many ſpake falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies were not conuenient. But at laſt came two falſe witneſſes,
 and riſing vp they gaue falſe witneſſe againſt him; for we heard him ſpeaking: I will deſtroy this Temple of God, made with hands, and after three dayes I will build another, not made with hands, and their testimony was not conuenient.

      * And the high Prieſt riſing vp in the middeſt of them,Mat. 26. Mar. 14. asked Ieſus ſaying: Doeſt thou anſwere nothing to thoſe thinges?
 which theſe men obiect againſt thee, and whereof they beare witnes, againſt thee? but Ieſus held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Againe the high Prieſt ſaid: I adiure thee by the liuing God that thou doſt tell vs, if thou art Chriſt the Sonne of our bleſſed God?

      * Ieſus ſaid vnto him, thou haſt
 ſaid:Mat. 26. Mar. 14. I am; but I ſay vnto you, hereafter yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, and cōming in the cloudes of Heauen.

      * Then the chiefe Prieſt rent his garments;Mat. 26. Mar. 14. ſaying: Hee hath blaſphemed, what neede wee witneſſes any further? beholde yee haue now heard the blaſphemy, what thinke yee? they anſwering ſaid, he is guilty of death.

      * And the men,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14 which helde Ieſus, mocked him, beating him, and they ſpet in his face, & beate him with blowes, & they couered him & ſtruck his face, & asked him, ſaying: Propheſie vnto vs, O Chriſt, who is hee, that ſtruck thee.

      * Luc. 22.And blaſpheming, they ſpake many other things againſt him.

      * Mat. 27. Mar 15 Luc. 22.And preſently in the morning as ſoon as it was day all the chiefe Prieſts, and the elders of the people, and the Scribes aſſembled together againſt Ieſus, that they might put him to death: and they brought him into their counſaile, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt tell vs.

      * And hee ſayde vnto them: If I ſhould tell you, you would
 not beleeue me: And if I ſhall aske, yee will not anſwere me, nor let me goe: But hereafter the Sonne of man ſhall be ſitting at the right hand of the power of God. And they all ſaid: art thou then the Sonne of God? who anſwered; you ſay, that I am.

      * But they ſaid, what neede wee teſtimony any further,Luc. 22. Mat. 26. Mar. 14. for wee our ſelues haue heard from his owne mouth. And all the multitude of them riſing, and binding Ieſus, brought him bound to Pilate the Preſident.

      * Then Iudas, who had betrayed him, ſeeing that hee was condemned,Mat. 27. repenting himſelfe brought againe the thirty peeces of ſiluer to the high Prieſtes, and to the Elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying iuſt bloud: But they ſaid, what is that to vs? Looke you to it.

      * And caſting downe the peeces of ſiluer in the Temple,Mat. 27. Act. 21. hee went aſide, and going away, he hanged himſelfe in a halter, & being hanged, hee brake in the midſt, and all his bowels were ſcattered.

      * But the chiefe Prieſts taking the monye ſaid:Mat. 27. It is not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud: and taking counſell they bought therwith a potters field, for the burial of ſtrangers, and for that cauſe
 the field is called Haceldema, that is, the field of bloud, euen to this day. Then it was fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet Hieremy: And they tooke thirty peeces of ſiluer being the price of the appriced, whome they priced of the Sonnes of Iſraell, and they gaue them into a potters field, as our Lord hath appointed me.

      * Then they brought Ieſus from Caiphas into the Palace,Ioan. 18. and it was morning, and they entered not into the Palace, becauſe they would not be defiled, but that they might eate the Paſch.

      * Ioan. 18.Then Pilate went foorth vnto them, & ſaid, what accuſation do you bring againſt this man? they āſwered him if he were not a malefactor we would not haue deliuered him to thee: Then ſaid Pilate to them, take ye him and according to your Law iudge him. The Iewes ſaid to him: It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: that the ſpeach of Ieſus might be fulfilled, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.

      * Then they beganne to accuſe him,Luc. 23. ſaying: We haue found this man ſubuerting our people, and forbidding to giue tribute vnto Caeſar, and ſaying, that hee is Chriſt our King.

      * Ioan. 18Then Pilate went againe into the Pallace, and called Ieſus, and Ieſus ſtoode before the Preſident.Mar. 27. And Pilate asked him: art thou King of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: doeſt thou ſpeake this of thy ſelfe, or haue others tolde it thee of me? Pilate anſwered: am I a Iew? thy people, and thy Prieſts haue deliuered thee to me, what haſt thou done?

      * Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this world: If my Kingdome were of this world, my Soldiours would fight for me, that I ſhould not be deliuered vp to the Iewes; but now my Kingdome is not from hence. Pilate ſaid vnto him; then art thou a King? Ieſus anſwered, thou ſayeſt, that I am a King.

      * I was borne in this, and to this I came into the world,Ioan. 18 that I may giue teſtimony vnto the truth: And euery one which is of the truth, heareth my voyce: Pilate ſaith vnto him, what is the truth?

      * Pilate went forth againe vnto the Iewes,Ioan. 18 •uc 23. Mar. 27. ſaying: I finde no cauſe in this man: But the high Prieſtes accuſed him in many things; and Ieſus anſwered nothing: Then Pilate asked him, ſaying to him: Doſt thou not heare howe great teſtimonies they ſpeake againſt thee? doſt thou not anſwere any thing? behold in how great things they acuſe thee?
 But Ieſus anſwered not him to any word,Mar. 15 ſo as the Preſident wondred greatly.

      * But they were more earneſt, ſaying:Luc. 23. He moued the people, teaching through all Iurie, beginning frōGalilee euen hither:

      * And Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the mā wer a Galilaean, & as ſoon as he knew that he was vnder the iuriſdiction of Herod,Luc. 23. he ſent him to Herod, who alſo in thoſe dayes was in Hieruſalem.

      * Herode, when he ſaw Ieſus, reioyced much,Luc. 23. for hee was deſirous a long time to ſee him, becauſe
 he had heard many thinges of him, and hee hoped to ſee ſome ſigne done by him: And he examined him with many queſtions: but hee anſwered nothing vnto him.

      * And the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes ſtood conſtantly accuſing
 him; but Herode deſpiſed him with his Army,Luc. 23. and mocked him, cloathing him in a white garment, and ſent him backe to Pilate.

      * And Herode and Pilate, were made friends in that day:Luc. 23. for they were enemyes before, one to another.

      * But Pilate calling the chiefe Prieſts,Luc. 23. and the Magiſtrates, and the people, ſayd vnto them: yee haue offered vnto me this mā,Mar. 27. as auerting the people; and behold I examining him before you,Mar. 15 finde no cauſe in this man of theſe things in which yee accuſe him, no nor Herod neither, For I haue ſent yee vnto him, and behold nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: therefore I will diſmiſſe him, being corrected: And on the ſolemne day, the Preſident had a cuſtome, and muſt of neceſſity diſmiſſe one of the priſoners, whom ſoeuer they ſhould require. And he had thē a notable priſoner called Barrabas, who was takē with the ſeditious, who in the ſedition had committed murther: Then Pilate ſaid: yee haue a cuſtome, that I diſmiſſe one in the Paſch: whome will yee that I diſmiſſe vnto you? Barrabas, or Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? for he knew, that the high prieſts had deliuerd him by enuy.

      * And as he was ſitting in place of iudgement,Mat. 27. his wife ſent vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothing to doe with that iuſt man: for I haue ſuffered many things this day in my ſleepe for him.

      * But the chiefe prieſts & elders ſtirred vp the multitude, & perſwaded the people that they ſhold demaund Barrabas and deſtroy Ieſus:Mat. 27. and when the multitude were come vp,Mar. 15 they began to pray Pilate, that hee would doe as he did alwaies vnto them.Luc. 23. And the Preſident anſwering ſaid to thē: which of the two will ye haue diſmiſſed?Ioan. 18. They all cryed out together, not him, but Barrabas take away him and diſmiſſe vnto vs Barabas: And Pilate anſwering againe ſaid to them: What then ſhal I do with Ieſus, who is called Chriſt? but they cryed out againe, let him be crucified, crucifie him crucifie him: but Pilate ſaid vnto them the third time: for what euill hath this man done? I finde no cauſe of death in him: therefore
 I will correct him, & diſmiſſe him: but they vrged with many cryes, deſiring, that he ſhould be crucified, and their voyces increaſed, and they cryed more, let him be crucified.

      * Then Pilate apprehended him and whipped him. Then the Soldiours of the Preſident taking Ieſus carryed him into the Pretors court, and they gathered together all the company vnto him.

      * Secondly, of the whipping it ſelfe.

      * Thirdly after his whipping.

      * Then they vncloathing him, put a ſcarlet Garment about him,Mat. 27 Mar. 15 Ioan. 19 and weauing a Crowne of thornes, they put it vpon his head and a Reede in his right hand.

      * And they came vnto him,Mat. 27. M•r 15. Ioan. 19 and bending their knee, they adored, and mocked him, and they began to ſalute him, ſaying: Haile King of the Iewes.

      * And they ſpit vpon him, and they tooke a reede,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19. and ſtrooke his head with the reede, and they gaue him blowes.

      * Pilate went foorth againe, and ſaid vnto them:Ioan. 19 Behold I bring him forth vnto you, that yee may know, that I find no cauſe in him.

      * Then Ieſus went foorth, carrying his thorny Crowne,Ioan. 19. & purple garment.

      * Ioan. 16Then whē the high Prieſts and the Miniſters ſawe him, they cryed, ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, take yee him and crucifie him:Ioan. 19. for I finde no cauſe in him.

      * Ioan. 19The Iewes anſwered him: we haue a Lawe, and according to the lawe he ought to dye, becauſe hee made himſelfe the Sonne of God.

      * When Pilate heard that ſpeach hee feared more,Ioan. 19 and entred againe into the Pallace, and ſaid vnto him, whence art thou? but Ieſus gaue him no anſwere.

      * Then Pilate ſaid vnto him: Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto mee?Ioan. 19 doeſt thou not knowe, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and power to diſmiſſe thee?

      * Ieſus anſwered, thou couldeſt haue no power againſt mee,Ioan. 19 except it were giuen thee from aboue. Wherefore hee, which hath deliuered mee to thee, hath the greater ſinne.

      * From thence foorth Pilate ſought to diſmiſſe him: but the Iewes cryed, ſaying: if thou doſt diſmiſſe him,Ioan. 19 thou art not friend to Caeſar: for euery one that maketh himſelfe King, contradicteth Caeſar: but when Pilate heard theſe ſpeaches, he brought Ieſus foorth, and ſate in the iudgement ſeate, in the place called Lithoſtrotos, but in hebrewe Gabbata; and it was the paraſeene, about the ſixt houre.

      * And Pilate ſaid to them, behold your king:Ioan. 19 and they cryed, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.

      * Pilate ſaid vnto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The Prieſts anſwered, wee haue no King, but Caeſar.

      * Mat. •7.And Pilate ſeeing, that he profited nothing, but that the tumult was made greater, taking water, waſhed his handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloud of this iuſt man; Looke yee to it.

      * And the whole people anſwered,Mat. 27 ſaying: His bloud bee vpon vs, and vpon our Children.

      * Then Pilate willing to ſatiſfie the people, adiudged,Mar. 15 Luc. 23 Mar. 27. Ioan. 19 that their petition ſhould be done: and he diſmiſſed vnto them him, which was ſent to priſon for murther and ſedition, Barrabas, whome they demaunded: but Ieſus being whipped he deliuered to their will, that hee ſhould bee crucified.

      * And the Soldiours tooke Ieſus,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Mar. 15. & pulling off his ſcarlet garmēt, they cloathed him in his own veſtments, & brought him foorth that they might crucifie him.

      * And carrying his Croſſe,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. hee went foorth into that place which is called Caluaria, and in the Hebrue, Golgotha: There were alſo carryed two
 wicked m•n with him, that they ſhould be put to death.

      * And going forth they found a certaine man of Cyrene,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 13. called Simon, comming from the countrey, the Father of Alexander and Rufus: him they compelled to take vp his Croſſe, and they inforced him to carry the Croſſe after Ieſus.

      * And there followed a great troope of people, and of women, which mourned,Luc. 23. and lamented him: and Ieſus turning vnto them ſaid: O Daughters of Hieruſalem, weepe not ouer mee, but weepe ouer your ſelues, and ouer your Children.

      * For behold the daies ſhall come, in which they ſhall ſay, bleſſed are the barren,Luc. 23 & the wombes, which haue not brought foorth, & the breaſts, which haue not giuen ſucke: then they ſhall begin to ſay to the Mountaines, fall vpon vs, and to the Hills, couer vs.

      * And they came into the place, which is called Golgotha, which is a place of Caluaria:Luc. 23. Mar. 27. Mar. 15. and they gaue him wine to drinke mixt mith gall: and when he had taſted, hee would not drinke: and it was the third houre.

      * And there they crucified him.Luc. 23. Ioan. 19

      * And they crucified with him two Theeues,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 Iſa. 53. one on the right hand, and the other on the left, and Ieſus in the middeſt: And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith: and hee was reputed with the wicked.

      * And Pilate wrote the title of his cauſe vpon his Croſſe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 and the ſuperſcription was ouer his head, and it was written in Hebrue, Greeke, & Latine.

      * Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.Ioan. 19.

      * Therefore many of the Iewes reade this title, for the place where Ieſus was crucified was neare the Cittie. Therefore the Prieſts ſaid to Pilate: doe not write, King of the Iewes but that he ſaid, I am King of the Iewes: Pilate anſwered: what I haue written, I haue written.

      * But Ieſus ſaid,

      * Luc. 23Father forgiue them.

      * For they knowe not what they doe.Luc. 23.

      * Ioan. 19Then the Soldiours, when they had crucified him, tooke his garments, (and made foure partes, to euery Soldiour a part) and his coate. And the coat was without ſeame wouen all ouer.

      * Then they ſaid amongſt themſelues,Ioan. 19 Mat. 24. Pſal. 21. Luc. 23 Mat. 16. let vs not cut, but let vs caſt lotts for it, whoſe it ſhall be; that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, ſaying: they parted my garments among them, and for my coat they did caſt lotts. Therfore diuiding his garments, they caſt lotts vpon them, which part euery one ſhould take.

      * And the Soldiours did theſe thinges: and ſitting kept him,Ioan. 19 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. and the people ſtood beholding.

      * And they that paſſed by, blaſphemed him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. ſhaking their heads and ſaying: Vah, thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, and in three dayes doeſt build it againe, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou beeſt the Sonne of God, come downe from the Croſſe.

      * In like manner with them did the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Scribes,Luc. 13. and Seniors deride him; and mocking they ſaid one to another: hee ſaued others, himſelfe he cannot ſaue: if he be the
 king of Iſrael, let him now deſcend from the Croſſe, that wee may ſee, and beleeue him: hee truſted in God; let him deliuer him now, if he will: for he ſaid, that I am the ſonne of God.

      * The Soldiers alſo mocked him,
 comming, and offering Vinegar, ſaying,Luc. 23. if thou art King of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe.

      * And the ſame thing did the Theeues,Mat. 27. Mat. 13. which were crucified with him, vpbraide vnto him: and one of the theeues, which were hanged, blaſphemed him, ſaying: If thou art Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe, and vs: but the other anſwering, blamed him, ſaying: Neither doeſt thou feare God, which art in the ſame condemnation?
 Wee indeede ſuffer iuſtly, for wee receiue worthy puniſhment for our facts, but this man hath done no euill.

      * And hee ſaid to Ieſus: O Lord remember mee, when thou ſhalt come into thy Kingdome.Luc. 23

      * And Ieſus ſaide to him: Amen I ſay to thee,Luc. 23. this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe.

      * And there ſtood by the Croſſe of Ieſus,Ioan. 19. his Mother, and his mothers ſiſter Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

      * Therefore when Ieſus ſawe his Mother, and the Diſciple whome hee loued,Ioan. 19 ſtanding, hee ſaid to his Mother: woman, behold thy Sonne.

      * Ioan. 19.Then hee ſaid to his Diſciple, beholde thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her as his owne.

      * And from the ſixt houre darkneſſe was made ouer the whole
 earth vntill the ninth houre, and the Sunne was darkned.Luc. 23.

      * About the nynth houre Ieſus cryed out with a loude voyce ſaying: Eli; Eli,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. lammaſa bactani: which is interpreted: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?

      * Mat. 27. Mar. 15But ſome ſtanding there, and hearing, ſaid: Beholde this man calleth Helias.

      * Afterwards Ieſus knowing, that all thinges were now conſummate,Ioan. 19. that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, hee ſaide I thirſt.

      * Then a veſſell of vineger was ſet,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Ioan. 19 and preſently one of them running, filled a ſponge, which
 he had with vineger, and ſet it vpon a reede, and Hyſope, and gaue him to drinke.

      * And he ſaid, let be,Mar. 15 Mat. 27. let vs ſee whether Helias come to take him downe: and the others ſaid, let be, let vs ſee, whether Helias come to deliuer him.

      * Ioan. 19.When Ieſus had taken the vineger, he ſaid.

      * It is conſummate.

      * It is Conſummate.

      * And crying againe,Mat. 27. Mar. 15. Luc. 23. he ſaide with a loude voyce.

      * Luc. 23.O Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Into thy handes I commend my ſpirit.

      * Luc. 23. Ioan. 19.And ſaying this, bowing his head, gaue vp the ghoſt.

      * He breathed foorth.Mar. 15. Luc. 23

      * Ioan. 19Hee ſent forth his ſpirit.

      * And behold the vaile of the Temple was ſlut in two peeces,Mat. 27. Mat. 15. Luc. 23. euen from the top to the bottome.

      * And the Earth was moued, and the Rock•s were cleft a ſunder.Mat. 27.

      * Mat. 27.And the Monuments were opened, & many bodyes of Saints which had ſlept, roſe: and going
 out of the monuments after his reſurrection, entred into the holy Citty, and appeared to many.

      * And the Centurion, which ſtoode ouer againſt him, and they which were with him,Mat. 27. Mar. 15 Luc. 23. keeping Ieſus, ſeeing that thus crying he dyed, and hauing ſeen the earthquake, and thoſe thinges which were done, they feared greatly.

      * Luc. 23. Mat. 27.And they glorified God, ſaying: Verily this man was iuſt:
 verily this man was the Sonne of God.Mar. 15.

      * And all the troupe of them, which were preſent at this ſpectacle,Luc. 23. and ſawe what thinges were
 done, returned, knocking their breaſtes. But all his acquaintance ſtood a farre off, and many women looking on him a farre off,Mat. 27. which followed Ieſus from Galile, miniſtring vnto him:Mar. 15. among whome was Mary Magdalene, and Mary Mother of Iames the leſſe, and of Ioſeph, and Salome, Mother of the ſonnes of Zebedee, and many other, which came together to Hieruſalem.

      * Ioan. 19.Then the Iewes (becauſe it was the Paraſeeue) that the bodyes might not remaine vpon the
 Croſſe on the Sabaoth (for that was a great Saboth day) intreated Pilate, that their leggs might bee broken, and they might bee taken away. The Soldiers therfore came, and indeed they brake the legges of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucified with him.

      * But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe him already dead, they did not breake his legges; but one of the Soldiers with a ſpeare opened his ſide, and preſently iſſued forth bloud and water.

      * And hee which ſawe it hath giuen teſtimony,Ioan. 19 & his teſtimony is true; and hee knoweth, that he ſaith true; that yee alſo may beleeue: for theſe things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled:Exo. 12. Yee ſhall not break a bone of him: and againe another Scripture ſaith: They ſhall looke on him,Zach. 12 whome they pierced.

      * When the euening was come, becauſe it was the Paraſcheue,Mat. 27. which is before the Sabaoth, behold there came a certaine rich man from Aramathia,Mar. 15. a Cittie in Iurie,Luc. 23. called Ioſeph, who was a Senatour,Ioan. 19 a good man and a iuſt, who himſelfe alſo was a Diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecret, for feare of the Iewes.

      * He had not conſented to their counſaile and acts,Luc. 23. Mar. 15. Mat. 27. Ioan. 19. for he alſo expected the kingdome of God. He boldly went into Pilate, and demaunded the body of Ieſus: but Pilate wondred, if he were already dead: and hauing ſent for the Centuriō, he asked him if he wer already dead: & when he knewe of the Centuriō, he was content, and cōmanded the body of Ieſus to be giuen him.

      * But Ioſeph hauing bought a cleane piece of linnen,Mar. 13 Mat. 27. Luc. 23. Ioan. 19 tooke down the body of Ieſus, and laying it downe, wrapped it in the cleane linnen.

      * And Nichodemus alſo came, who had come firſt to Ieſus in the night,Ioan. 19. bringing a mixture of Myrrhe, and Aloes, about a hundreth poundes. And they took the body of Ieſus, and bound it in linned, with ſpices, as the custom of the Iewes is to bury.

      * And there was in the place, where hee was crucified, a Garden,Ioan. 19. Luc. 23. Mat. 27. Mar. 15. and in the garden, a Monument, which Ioſeph had cut out in a Rocke, in which neuer any was yet laide. Therefore, for the Paraſceue of the Iewes, they laid Ieſus, becauſe the Monument was hard by. And Ioſeph rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Monument, and went his way.

      * And Mary Magdalene, & Mary of Ioſeph were ſitting there againſt the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. and the women which came with him from Galilee,Mar. 15. and followed him, beheld where the body of Ieſus was laide;Luc. 23. and returning, they prepared ſpices and oyntments: and on the Sabaoth they reſted for the Commandement.

      * And the next day, which is after the Paraſceue, the chiefe Prieſts & the Phariſes came together to Pilate, ſaying: Maiſter wee remember, that this ſeducer ſaide, whileſt he liued: after three dayes I will riſe againe: Commaund therefore that the Sepulcher may bee kept till the third day;Mat. 27. leaſt perhaps his Diſciples come and ſteale him away, and ſay to the people hee is riſen from death: and the laſt error will bee worſe then the firſt.

      * Pilate ſaid to them, ye haue a guard, goe, and keepe him, as ye knowe.

      * And they going away garded the Sepulcher,Mat. 27. marking the ſtone with Watchman.
